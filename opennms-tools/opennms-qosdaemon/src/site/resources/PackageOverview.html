<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>The qosdaemon provides an
elementary OSS/J Qos interface for OpenNMS. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>For more information on
the OSS/J Qos Specification please see the OSS/J site </FONT><A HREF="http://www.ossj.org/"><FONT SIZE=2>www.ossj.org</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2>.
For more details on configuration and functionality provided please
see the documentation and example configuration in the
$opennms_home/contrib/qosdaemon directory. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>The interface can run
natively in OpenNMS and use OSS/J XML messages to reflect the state
of the OpenNMS internal alarm list or it can use an external ejb
running in JBOSS to expose the alarm list as JVT objects. Currently
only OSS/J XVT and XML AlarmEvents have been implemented. A future
release will service OSS/J XML queries. The interface uses the
services of an external JMS provider. We use the JbossMQ
implementation of JMS however it should be fairly easy to substitute
another JMS implementation.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>This interface is in two
parts which can be run separately as two opennms daemons; </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>qosd is an OSS/J server
which exposes the OpenNMS alarm list as an OSS/J alarm list to other
systems. The changes to the local alarm list are exposed as JMS XML
messages which can be used to update an alarm list in a remote
client.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>qosdrx is an OSS/J event
client which can listen for alarm update events from other servers.
It updates the local OpenNMS alarm list based upon the received
events.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>During the development of
the qosdaemon, OpenNMS migrated to using the Spring framework. This
has been adopted extensively in the design of the qosdrx daemon.
However some of the code in the qosd daemon pre-dated the
introduction of spring and has been adapted to use spring rather than
re-written. This has lead to a somewhat convoluted initialization
process which will be tidied up in a later release. In general most
classes use injection of control and spring wiring to get their
dependencies and most classes are exposed as implementations of
interfaces with the 'impl' suffix to their name. Where classes have
been re-implemented or gone through several versions, the implxx
suffix is used where xx indicates the version. This has allowed
several versions of the same class to co exist and be wired in for
testing etc during development. ( As an example see QosDimpl2.java )</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none"><FONT SIZE=2>The
OssDao package provides a buffer between the internals of OpenNMS and
the requirements of the OSS/J code. The internal alarm definition in
OpenNMS contains different fields and severity values to the OSS/J
X.733 definitions. This mapping is (mostly) confined to the
OnmsAlarmOssjMapper class. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none"><FONT SIZE=2>The
OpenNMS alarm definition has been extended to allow it to represent
alarms from remote systems. Each OpenNMS alarm now contains an
ApplicationDN which identifies the unique name of the remote system
which generated the alarm and an OssPrimaryKey which identifies the
local identifier for that alarm on the remote machine. When an alarm
update event is received, the OssDao searches for an existing alarm
with matching ApplicationDN and OssPrimaryKey in order to do the
update. (If ApplicationDN is blank then the alarm is from the local
machine).</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none"><FONT SIZE=2>Each
OSS/J alarm contains an identifier for the managed object which
issued the alarm. This is always mapped to an OpenNMS node. The Asset
Register entry for nodes now has extra fields to uniquely identify
the managed object system wide ( ManagedObjectInstance and
ManagedObjectClass) . The OssDao provides methods to do a rapid
reverse look up on the Asset register to find nodes with a unique id
which is given by the concatenation of the ManagedObjectInstance and
ManagedObjectClass. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none"><FONT SIZE=2>Note
that when the OssDao is initialized, the QoSDrx log file will record
any nodes having no data or duplicate data in the
ManagedObjectInstance and ManagedObjectType fields of the Asset
table. If the ManagedObjectInstance and ManagedObjectType fields of
nodes are empty or duplicated the OSS/J Alarm management will not
work correctly.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2><U>Overview</U></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>The QoSD Daemon realises
an OSS/J QoS server interface by mediating between the OpenNMS
internal alarm management model and an OSS/J implementation realized
using the OSSBeans OSS/J Qos library. The OSSbeans AlarmMonitor bean
can run natively in the OpenNMS spring container or in a remote the
Jboss J2EE server. If it is running in the remote J2EE server then it
exposes it's alarm list according to OSS/J semantics as JVT objects
through a facade bean. Note that presently only a very simple query
is currently supported to get the entire alarm list. The AlarmMonitor
bean also sends out XVT ( XML) and JVT AlarmEvents as the alarm list
changes. In the future it is intended to extend the OssBeans alarm
monitor to also support full JVT and XML queries. If the AlarmMonitor
bean is running natively in OpenNMS, it cannot expose the OSS/J JVT
interface and only generates the JMS events however it is envisaged
that this is the way most users will want to use the interface.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2><U>How it works</U></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none"><FONT SIZE=2>The
qosd.properties file contains the address information for the Qosd to
connect to it's JMS queues. The configuration for the QoSD daemon is
picked up from the /etc/qosd.properties file using the singleton
PropertiesLoader class. ( In the future this could be picked up using
the spring application context in a similar manner to the qosdrx
code. )</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>The QosD Daemon registers
with the OpenNMS eventd daemon to receive events using the call;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>eventIpcManager.addEventListener(this,
ueiList); </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>The events which qosd
responds to are determined by the ueiList object which is configured
by the QosDConfigFactory using and the QoSDConfiguration.xml file in
the OpenNMS /etc directory. Castor is used to un-marshal the XML into
the ueiList according to the QoSDConfiguration.xsd file. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>When an event which qosd
has registered for occurs its onEvent() method is called. Qosd
responds to two types of events. Firstly any events corresponding to
changes in the asset register are used to force an update in the
OssDao node cache. Secondly an 'alarm changed event' causes the qosd
to review the local OpenNMS alarm list for changes. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>The qosd depends upon the
vacuumd daemon which must be configured with an automation to look
for new or changed alarms in the local alarm list and throw an 'alarm
changed event' if a change is detected. An example
vacuumd-configuration.xml file is included in
/contrib/qosdaemon/qos-example-configuration. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>The vacuumd automation
also implements the X733 alarm life cycle whereby OpenNMS correlates
alarm raising and alarm clearing SNMP traps and removes cleared and
acknowledged alarms from the alarm list. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>Qosd responds to an alarm
changed event by causing the OssDao to update it's cache of OnmsAlarm
values with a new snapshot of the alarm list in the database,
translates the OnmsAlarm values to OSS/J AlarmValues using the
OnmsAlarmOssjMapper and then forwards this new list of alarms to the
OSSBeans AlarmMonitor bean. The AlarmMonitor bean compares this new
list with it's existing list and sends out AlarmEvents as alarms in
its current list are added, deleted or changed to match the new list.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>The
AlarmListConnectionManager interface determines whether the remote
J2EE or local spring implementation of the AlarmMonitor is used. Two
implementations of the AlarmListConnectionManager are available to be
wired in using spring; AlarmListConnectionManagerJ2eeImpl connects to
the remote bean using RMI. AlarmListConnectionManagerSpringImpl.java
implements the bean locally.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>This choice is determined
by the setting of the system variable -Dqosd.usej2ee={true}|{false}'
in the /etc/opennms.conf file which is read when the qosd is
initialized. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>In a heavy alarm storm,
vacuumd could trigger multiple alarm changed events such that qosd
initiates multiple parallel look ups to the database which would be
very costly. The OpenNMSEventHandlerThread is used to avoid this
eventuality by latching any new alarm changed events while a database
look up is being performed. Thus a lookup has to complete before a
new one is initiated. All of the changes which occur during this time
will be picked up on the next alarm retrieval. </FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2><U>Overview</U></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>The QoSDrx daemon
implements multiple OSS/J JMS event listener clients for OpenNMS.
Each client connects to a different OSS/J JMS AlarmEvent Topic on a
JMS provider (tested with JbossMQ but other providers could be used )
. Alarm Events are used to update the local OpenNMS alarm list such
that it mirrors the alarm event list in the remote OSS/J servers. The
clients are fully configurable using an XML configuration file in the
/etc directory. Planned future extensions to the Daemon will allow it
to also synchronize with remote servers using OSS/J XML queries. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2><U>How It Works</U></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>The QoSDrx Daemon realises
an OSS/J QoS client interface using the OSSBeans OSS/J Qos library.
The Library provides a collection of classes for implementing clients
and servers for receiving or transmitting OSS/J messages as XML or
JVT objects. Fundamental to the library is the concept of an OSSbean
which is spring class which can be run as a separate thread for
handling OSS/J messages and is configured using a spring application
context XML file.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>As with the QoSD daemon,
the qosdrx.jmx classes (QoSDrx and QoSDrxMBean) are used by opennms
to spawn the qosdrx daemon and initialise an OssDao if it does not
already exist. The daemon passes the OpenNMS application context to
the OSSBeans OSSBeanRunner class which reads the
/etc/QoSDrxOssBeanRunnerSpringContext.xml file to generate an
application context and spawn separate threads for each defined
OssBeanAlarmEventReceiver class. Each OssBeanAlarmEventReceiver then
registers to listen to it's defined JMS AlarmEventTopic and waits to
receive OSS/J AlarmEvents ( both XVT and JVT events are supported ).
If any receiver cannot attach or gets disconnected from its JMS
Topic, it waits for a defined timeout and then tries to reconnect.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>The
OssBeanAlarmEventReceivers need to have
AlarmEventReceiverEventHandler classes assigned which are used to
perform appropriate actions on reception of each event. The QoSDrx
daemon defines an AlarmEventReceiverEventHandler implementation which
interacts with the OssDao to update the OpenNMS Alarm list database
on each received event. ( The present QoSDrx demon
AlarmEventReceiverEventHandler implementation is called
QoSDrxAlarmEventReceiverEventHandlerImpl2 )</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>The intention of this
design is to extend the OSSbean concept in the future to make each
OSSbean also a JMX Mbean. This would allow finer real time monitoring
and management of each receiver client. However in the present design
all of the OSSbeans are spawned off the root OpenNMS JMX bean which
is able to report the statistics from all of the beans using the
OpenNMS MX4J console.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2><U>Alarm Life cycle</U></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>Note that the present use
case only utilizes NewAlarmEvent and AlarmCleared events to update
the Alarm list. Other AlarmEvents are simply logged. However the
QoSDrxAlarmEventReceiverEventHandlerImpl can easily be extended to
use more of the OSS/J alarm event types if a tighter coupling between
client and server is required. The following process is followed by
QoSDrx to process AlarmEvents;</FONT></P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>When an NewAlarmEvent
	message is received, it's ApplicationDN and OssPrimaryKey are

	should be configured with nodes named after the name of each
	OssBeanAlarmEventReceiver. When an alarm comes in to a given topic,
	the alarm is logged in OpenNMS against a node named with the same
	name as the OssBeanAlarmEventReceiver. This is a good configuration
	if you simply want to look at alarms from subordinate OSS/J servers
	on a per server basis but you don't want to put every managed object

	nodes (with the same Asset data for managedObjectInstance and
	ManagedObjectType) as populated in the subordinate OpenNMS's</FONT></P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>Note that in both the
	above cases, regardless of how the alarm is displayed locally, it
	will be forwarded through QosD with the same managedObjectInstance
	and ManagedObjectType as the original message. ( i.e. OpenNMS will
	not modify the origin of the message even though it displays it
	against a different node locally )</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>When an
	AlarmClearedEvent message is received it's ApplicationDN and
	OssPrimaryKey are checked against the OpenNMS alarm list. If the
	alarm does not exist, there is an error which is logged and the
	ClearedAlarmEvent message is ignored ( the ClearedAlarmEvent
	messages should refer to an existing alarm ).</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>If the corresponding
	alarm exists in the Alarm List, it will be set to cleared and
	acknowledged. The vacummd process will subsequently remove the
	cleared and acknowledged alarm from the alarm list. </FONT>
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2>Note that the behavior of
	the interface could easily be extended to allow usage of separate
	acknowledgment messages of cleared alarms before removing them from
	the list. However this has not been done as it appeared to
	complicate the use case without much extra value. In the future we
	will make alternative alarm life cycle behaviour's a configurable
	item.</FONT></P>
