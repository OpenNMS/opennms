The QoSDrx daemon implements multiple OSS/J JMS event
listener clients for OpenNMS. Each client connects to a
different OSS/J JMS AlarmEvent Topic on a JMS provider
(tested with JbossMQ but other providers could be used ).
Alarm Events are used to update the local OpenNMS alarm
list such that it mirrors the alarm event list in the
remote OSS/J servers. The clients are fully configurable
using an XML configuration file in the /etc directory.
