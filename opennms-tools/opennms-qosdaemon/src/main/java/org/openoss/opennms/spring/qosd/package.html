Qosd responds to an alarm changed event by causing the OssDao to
update it's cache of OnmsAlarm values with a new snapshot of the
alarm list in the database, translates the OnmsAlarm values to OSS/J
AlarmValues using the OnmsAlarmOssjMapper and then forwards this new
list of alarms to the OSSBeans AlarmMonitor bean.
The AlarmMonitor bean compares this new list with it's existing list
and sends out AlarmEvents as alarms in its current list are added,
deleted or changed to match the new list.
