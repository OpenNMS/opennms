/**
 * Implements CollectionSetVisitor to implement thresholding.
 * Works by simply recording all the attributes that come in via visitAttribute
 * into an internal data structure, per resource, and then on "completeResource", does
 * threshold checking against that in memory structure.
 *
 * Suggested usage is one per CollectableService; this object holds the current state of thresholds
 * for this interface/service combination
 * (so perhaps needs a better name than ThresholdingVisitor)
 * 
 * Assumes and requires that the any visitation start at CollectionSet level, so that the collection timestamp can
 * be recorded.
