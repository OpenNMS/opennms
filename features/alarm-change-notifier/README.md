# Alarm Change Notifier OpenNMS plugin

## Maven project

~~~~
project groupId: org.opennms.plugins
project name:    alarm-change-notifier
version:         22.0.0-SNAPSHOT
~~~~

## Description
This project generates new OpenNMS events corresponding to changes in alarms
The new events are defined in the AlarmChangeNotifierEvents.xml file

These events contain a json copy of the database table before changes in %parm[oldalarmvalues]%
and after changes in %parm[newalarmvalues]%

%parm[alarmid]% contains the alarmid of the alarm which has changed

The generated event itself references copies of the nodeid, interface and service contained in the original alarm. 
This way the alarm change events are associated with the otiginal source of the alarm.

Alarm change events have a severity of normal since they only reflect changes to the alarm.

Events from the alarm-change-notifier are used by the opennms-es-rest plugin to send alarm history to Elasticsearch
(See https://github.com/gallenc/opennms-es-rest)


## To install on OpenNMS

sudo vi /opt/opennms/org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.cfg

    http://repo1.maven.org/maven2@id=central, \
    http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/servicemix/m2-repo@id=servicemix, \
