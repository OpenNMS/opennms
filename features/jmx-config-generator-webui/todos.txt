 The "jmxconfiggenerator.webui" is not finished yet.
 Therefore several todos have to be completed before the "tool" 
 is ready for production use. The following lists does sum up all 
 open issues/todos but may not be complete.
 
 
- In the MBeans Configuration View the tree view on the left does not show any
  validation error indicators if any element fails validation. So it is very hard
  to find any errors
  
- In the OpenNMS Configuration View the configuration snippet for the collectd-configuration.xml 
  is not yet generated.
  
 - In the OpenNMS Configuration View the "download" button just downloads the configuration
   in the currently selected tab, but should behave like a "download all" button.
   
 - In the OpenNMS Configuration View the order of the tabs is not fixed, but should be
   because it may cause some trouble for the user. It should always be for example: 
   collectd-configuration.xml, <service>.xml, <service>-graph.properties
   
- The header (1. Introduction View, etc...) should have an OpenNMS style

- The whole application should have an OpenNMS style

- All buttons should have a size where the icons does not look that akward

- All "next" buttons should have the caption on the left and not on the right side 
  (except the download button on the ResultConfigView)
  
- The code should be more documented.

- Take care of the todos in the code.

- The MBeansView should be handled as one component, especially the validation.
  At the moment the validation is implemented at least twice (in each component plus in the MBeansView).
  There should be something like a "ValidationRegistry" which allows using the same validation in the
  whole view and in all sub views.
  The registry should be used e.g. like this:
  	MBeansViewValidationRegistry.getInstance().registerValidator(MBeans.class, new NameValidator());
  	MBeansViewValidationRegistry.getInstance().getValidators(MBeans.class);
  Be aware, that we can use the ValidationRegistry for the whole application or simply for the MBeansView.
  Currently I would just use it for the MBeansView. The other views are not that complex
