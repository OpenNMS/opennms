	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	This wizard helps to create multiple configuration snippets which you
	can add to your OpenNMS configuration files to create a monitor with a
	data collection of any external Java application which has connecting
	via JMX<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> enabled (e.g. a Java Application
	Server).<br /> <br /> The wizard has multiple steps. These are:

	<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
	This Introduction view. <br />

	<h2>2. Service Configuration</h2>
	The external java application provides multiple information via so
	called Managed Beans (MBeans)<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>. To
	retrieve all MBeans provided by the java application we want to monitor
	we have to set up multiple connection settings, e.g. the host and port.
	After we have done that, all MBeans are collected and shown to the user
	(see step 3) to make some changes.

	<h2>3. MBeans Configuration</h2>
	After setting up the Service Configuration all Managed Beans from the
	external java application were retrieved. So we have got a whole bunch
	of MBeans collected, but not all of them are relevant for our monitor.
	So we can add or remove MBeans from the monitor scope. We can also make
	some changes to make the MBean names (and attributes, and so on) more
	human readable.

	<h2>4. OpenNMS Configuration</h2>
	After we have configured the MBeans we want to monitor multiple
	configuration snippets have been generated according to the settings
	during this wizard. The configuration files now have to be put into
	your running OpenNMS. This is described in more detail in this step.
