After setting up the Service Configuration all Managed Beans from the
external java application were retrieved. There are a whole bunch
of MBeans collected, but not all of them are relevant for datacollection.
MBeans/Attributes can now be deselected/selected to match your datacollection needs.
It is also possible to make minor changes to the MBean names (and attributes, and so on).
