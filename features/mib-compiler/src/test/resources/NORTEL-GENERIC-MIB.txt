           DESCRIPTION    
                  "This OID represents the Network Management Interface (NMI)
                   branch for the Nortel Networks's generic MIBs suite. 
                   Nortel NMI is an umbrella to include various generic MIBs 
                   that can be implemented by Nortel devices to 
                   interface to a carrier grade Network Management System (NMS). 

                   This branch currently consists of MIBs to support carrier
                   grade alarm surveillance. Characteristics of such a system
                   as applicable to this interface are 
                         - reliable and accurate alarm service 
                         - capability to summarise currently outstanding alarms
                         - no stuck alarms, no need to age out / manually clear alarms
                         - standards based open interface to alarms 

                   For future revisions of the Nortel NMI MIBs, it is 
                   mandatory to ensure that the changes are backward 
                   compatible. It is very IMPORTANT to follow the 
                   SMI rules at RFC 1902 to ensure that no 
                   non-backward compatible changes are made
                   as multiple applications use this for various purposes.
                   This MIB is entensible, but the current set of variables
                   cannot be modified.
