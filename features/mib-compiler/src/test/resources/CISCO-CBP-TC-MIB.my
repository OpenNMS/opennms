    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB module defines textual conventions used by the
        CISCO-CBP-BASE-CFG-MIB, CISCO-CBP-BASE-MON-MIB, and any MIB
        modules extending these MIB modules."
    REVISION        "200806240000Z"
    DESCRIPTION
        "The initial version of the MIB module."
    ::= { ciscoMgmt 662 }



CbpElementName ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT    "127a"
    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "A string-value that identifies an element used to specify
        a class-based policy.  The semantics of the string-value are
        the same those specified by the SnmpAdminString textual
        convention defined by the SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB [RFC3411].

        Observe that the null string is reserved for cases when an
        instance of an object needs to specify 'no element'."

        Describing Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
        Management Frameworks', RFC-3411, December 2002."
    SYNTAX          OCTET STRING (SIZE (0..127))

CbpElementIdentifier ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "A positive, non-zero integer-value that uniquely identifies
        an element used to specify a class-based policy."
    SYNTAX          Unsigned32 (1..4294967295)

CbpElementIdentifierOrZero ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This textual convention serves as an extension of the
        CbpElementIdentifier textual convention, which permits the value
        '0'.  The use of the value '0' is specific to an object, thus
        requiring the descriptive text associated with the object to
        describe the semantics of its use."
    SYNTAX          Unsigned32 (0..4294967295)

CbpInstanceIdentifier ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "A positive, non-zero integer-value that uniquely identifies
        an instance of an element used to define a class-based policy."
    SYNTAX          Unsigned32 (1..4294967295)

CbpInstanceIdentifierOrZero ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This textual convention serves as an extension of the
        CbpInstanceIdentifier textual convention, which permits the
        value '0'.  The use of the value '0' is specific to an object,
        thus requiring the descriptive text associated with the object
        to describe the semantics of its use."
    SYNTAX          Unsigned32 (0..4294967295)

CbpExecutionPriority ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "An positive, integer-value denoting the relative priority of an
        element, where '1' represents the highest priority and greater
        values represent lower priorities.

        The priority assigned to an element determines the order in
        which the system processes the elements relative to like
        elements having the same parent, where the system processes
        elements having a greater priority first.  The system processes
        sibling elements having the same priority in the order they were
        created."
    SYNTAX          Unsigned32 (1..4294967295)

CbpExecutionStrategy ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "An enumerated integer-value describing how to execute an
        ordered set of actions:

            'other'
                The implementation of the MIB using this textual
                convention does not recognize the specified execution
                strategy.

            'doUntilSuccess'
                The system sequentially executes the actions in the
                set until one succeeds.

            'doUntilFailure'
                The system sequentially executes the actions in the
                set until one fails.

            'doAll'
                The system sequentially executes all actions in the set,
                regardless of whether they succeed or fail."
    SYNTAX          INTEGER  {
                        other(1),
                        doUntilSuccess(2),
                        doUntilFailure(3),
