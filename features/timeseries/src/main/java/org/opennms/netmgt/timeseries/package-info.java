/**
 * The Timeseries Integration Layer allows for easy integration of 3rd party timeseries databases in OpenNMS.
 * In order to add a new timeseries database you need to implement {@link org.opennms.integration.api.v1.timeseries.TimeSeriesStorage}.
 * See https://docs.opennms.org/opennms/releases/26.1.1/guide-admin/guide-admin.html#ga-opennms-operation-timeseries for details.
 *
 * We deal with different types data:
 * - Metric: Identifies a unique timeseries. For details, see {@link org.opennms.integration.api.v1.timeseries.Metric}
 * - Sample: Describes a single value at a given point in time for a Metric, see @{@link org.opennms.integration.api.v1.timeseries.Sample
 *           It is stored in the timeseries database
 * - Resource meta data: Stored internally in OpenNMS. It contains key value pairs attached to a Resource.
 *           This data is not passed on the the timeseries database, see {@link org.opennms.netmgt.timeseries.meta.TimeSeriesMetaDataDao}.
 * - meta data tags: additional data that can be exported to the timeseries database as meta tags in the Metric. Configured via opennms.properties,
 *           see {@link org.opennms.netmgt.timeseries.integration.persistence.MetaTagDataLoader}
