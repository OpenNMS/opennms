/**
 * 
 * Pinger Design
 * 
 * The pinger has four components that are all static
 * 
 * an icmpSocket
 * a pendingRequest map
 * a pendingReply queue (LinkedBlockingQueue)
 * a timeout queue (DelayQueue)
 * 
 * It also has three threads:
 * 
 * a thread to read from the icmpSocket - (icmp socket reader)
 * a thread to process the pendingReplyQueue - (icmp reply processor)
 * a thread to process the timeouts (icmp timeout processor)
 * 
 * Processing:
 * 
 * All requests are asynchronous (if synchronous requests are need that
 * are implemented using asynchronous requests and blocking callbacks)
 * 
 * Making a request: (client thread)
 * - create a pingRequest 
 * - add it to a pendingRequestMap
 * - send the request
 * - add it to the timeout queue
 * 
 * Reading from the icmp socket: (icmp socket reader)
 * - read a packet from the socket
 * - construct a reply object 
 * - verify it is an opennms gen'd packet
 * - add it to the pendingReply queue
 * 
 * Processing a reply: (icmp reply processor)
 * - take a reply from the pendingReply queue
 * - look up and remove the matching request in the pendingRequest map
 * - call request.processReply(reply) - this will store the reply and
 *   call the handleReply call back
 * - pending request sets completed to true
 * 
 * Processing a timeout:
 * - take a request from the timeout queue
 * - if the request is completed discard it
 * - otherwise, call request.processTimeout(), this will check the number
 *   of retries and either return a new request with fewer retries or
 *   call the handleTimeout call back
 * - if processTimeout returns a new request than process it as in Making
 *   a request 
 * 
 * Thread Details:
 * 
 * 1.  The icmp socket reader that will listen on the ICMP socket.  It
 *     will pull packets off the socket and construct replies and add
 *     them to a LinkedBlockingQueue
 * 
 * 2.  The icmp reply processor that will pull replies off the linked
 *     blocking queue and process them.  This will result in calling the
 *     PingResponseCallback handleReply method.
 * 
 * 3.  The icmp timeout processor that will pull PingRequests off of a
 *     DelayQueue.  A DelayQueue does not allow things to be removed from
 *     them until the timeout has expired.
