		maxInMemory                    - Sets the maximum number of objects that will be created in memo
		eternal                        - Sets whether elements are eternal. If eternal,  timeouts are ignored and the element is never expired.
		overflowToDisk                 - Sets whether elements can overflow to disk when the in-memory cache has reached the maxInMemory limit.
 
		The following attributes are optional:
		timeToIdleSeconds              - Sets the time to idle for an element before it expires.  i.e. The maximum amount of time between accesses before an element expires Is only used if the element is not eternal.
		Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that an Element can idle for infinity.
		The default value is 0.
		timeToLiveSeconds              - Sets the time to live for an element before it expires.
		i.e. The maximum time between creation time and when an element expires.
		Is only used if the element is not eternal.
		Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that and Element can live for infinity.

		diskPersistent                 - Whether the disk store persists between restarts of the Virtual Machine.
 
		The default value is false.
		diskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds- The number of seconds between runs of the disk expiry thread.
