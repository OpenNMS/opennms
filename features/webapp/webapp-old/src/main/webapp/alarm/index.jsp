      <p>Alarms can be <em>acknowledged</em>, or removed from the view of other users, by
        selecting the alarm in the <em>Ack</em> check box and clicking the <em>Acknowledge
        Selected Alarms</em> at the bottom of the page.  Acknowledging an alarm gives
        users the ability to take personal responsibility for addressing a network
        or systems-related issue.  Any alarm that has not been acknowledged is
        active in all users' browsers and is considered <em>outstanding</em>.
      </p>
            
      <p>If an alarm has been acknowledged in error, you can select the 
        <em>View all acknowledged alarms</em> link, find the alarm, and <em>unacknowledge</em> it,
        making it available again to all users' views.
      </p>
        
      <p>If you have a specific alarm identifier for which you want a detailed alarm
        description, type the identifier into the <em>Get details for Alarm ID</em> box and
        hit <b>[Enter]</b>.  You will then go to the appropriate details page.
