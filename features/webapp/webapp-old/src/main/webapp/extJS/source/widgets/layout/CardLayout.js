/**
 * @class Ext.layout.CardLayout
 * @extends Ext.layout.FitLayout
 * <p>This layout contains multiple panels, each fit to the container, where only a single panel can be
 * visible at any given time.  This layout style is most commonly used for wizards, tab implementations, etc.
 * This class is intended to be extended or created via the layout:'card' {@link Ext.Container#layout} config,
 * and should generally not need to be created directly via the new keyword.</p>
 * <p>The CardLayout's focal method is {@link #setActiveItem}.  Since only one panel is displayed at a time,
 * the only way to move from one panel to the next is by calling setActiveItem, passing the id or index of
 * the next panel to display.  The layout itself does not provide a mechanism for handling this navigation,
 * so that functionality must be provided by the developer.</p>
 * <p>In the following example, a simplistic wizard setup is demonstrated.  A button bar is added
 * to the footer of the containing panel to provide navigation buttons.  The buttons will be handled by a
 * common navigation routine -- for this example, the implementation of that routine has been ommitted since
 * it can be any type of custom logic.  Note that other uses of a CardLayout (like a tab control) would require a
 * completely different implementation.  For serious implementations, a better approach would be to extend
 * CardLayout to provide the custom functionality needed.  Example usage:</p>
 * <pre><code>
var navHandler = function(direction){
    // This routine could contain business logic required to manage the navigation steps.
    // It would call setActiveItem as needed, manage navigation button state, handle any
    // branching logic that might be required, handle alternate actions like cancellation
    // or finalization, etc.  A complete wizard implementation could get pretty
    // sophisticated depending on the complexity required, and should probably be
    // done as a subclass of CardLayout in a real-world implementation.
};

var card = new Ext.Panel({
    title: 'Example Wizard',
    layout:'card',
    activeItem: 0, // make sure the active item is set on the container config!
    bodyStyle: 'padding:15px',

        // applied to each contained panel

            disabled: true
        },
        '->', // greedy spacer so that the buttons are aligned to each side
        {
            id: 'move-next',
            text: 'Next',
            handler: navHandler.createDelegate(this, [1])
