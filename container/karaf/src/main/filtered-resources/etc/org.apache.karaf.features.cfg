# Resource repositories (OBR) that the features resolver can use
# to resolve requirements/capabilities
#
# The format of the resourceRepositories is 
# resourceRepositories=[xml:url|json:url],...
# for Instance:
#
#resourceRepositories=xml:http://host/path/to/index.xml
# or
#resourceRepositories=json:http://host/path/to/index.json
#

#
# Defines if the boot features are started in asynchronous mode (in a dedicated thread)
#
featuresBootAsynchronous=false

#
# Service requirements enforcement
#
# By default, the feature resolver checks the service requirements/capabilities of
# bundles for new features (xml schema >= 1.3.0) in order to automatically installs
# the required bundles.
# The following flag can have those values:
#   - disable: service requirements are completely ignored
#   - default: service requirements are ignored for old features
#   - enforce: service requirements are always verified
#
# OPENNMS: We need to disable this so that Pax Web doesn't complain about bring run
# inside our Felix bridge HTTP service (which does not implement the Pax Web services)
serviceRequirements=disable

#
# Store cfg file for config element in feature
#
#configCfgStore=true
