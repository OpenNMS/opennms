== Writing
The following rules will help you to commit correctly formatted and prepared documentation for inclusion in the OpenNMS project.
It is important that we maintain a level of consistency across all of our committers and the documentation they produce.

When writing place a single sentence on each line.
This makes it easy to move content around, and also easy to spot long, or fragmented, sentences.
This will also allow us to assign comments on a sentence in GitHub which will facilitate easier merging.

NOTE: Other than writing documentation, you can help out by providing comments on documentation, reviewing, suggesting improvements or reporting bugs.
To do this head over to: http://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS/component/10011[issue tracker for documentation]!

[[doc-guidelines-conventions]]
=== Conventions for text formatting
The following conventions are used:

* File names and path are written in `'poller-configuration.xml'` they will be rendered in: 'poller-configuration.xml';
* Names that indicate special attention, e.g. this configuration matches \*any* entry: this is rendered as: this configuration matches *any* entry;
* \_Italics_ is rendered as _Italics_ and used for emphasis and indicate internal names and abbreviations;
* \*Bold* is rendered as *Bold* and should be used sparingly, for strong emphasis only;
* \+methodName()+ is rendered as +methodName()+ and is also used for literals,
  (note: the content between the `+` signs _will_ be parsed);
* \`command` is rendered as `command` (typically used for command-line or parts used in configuration files),
  (note: the content between the +`+ signs _will not_ be parsed);
* Mono\+\+space\++d is rendered as Mono++space++d and is used for monospaced letters;
* \'my/path/' is rendered as 'my/path/' this is used for file names and paths;
* \\``double quote'' (which is two grave accents to the left and two acute accents to the right) renders as ``double quote'';
* \`single quote' (which is a single grave accent to the left and a single acute accent to the right) renders as `single quote'.

[[doc-guidelines-gotchas]]
=== Gotchas

* Always leave a blank line at the top of the documents section.
It might be the title ends up in the last paragraph of the document;
* Always leave a blank line at the end of documents;
* As +{}+ are used for Asciidoc attributes, everything inside will be treated as an attribute.
  To avoid this you have to escape the opening brace: +\\{+.
  If you do not escape the opening brace, the braces and the text inside them will be removed without any warning being issued!;
* Forcing line breaks can be achieved with ` +` at the end of the line followed by a line break.

.Example in source force line break
[source]
----
This is the first line +
and this a forced 2nd line
----

.Rendered output with forced line break
This is the first line +
and this a forced 2nd line

== Headings and document structure

Each document starts over with headings from level zero (the document title).
Each document should have an id.
In some cases sections in the document need to have id's as well, this depends on where they fit in the overall structure.
If you wish to have a link to specific content that content has to have an id.
A missing id in a mandatory place will cause the build to fail.

To start a document:

[source]
----
[[unique-id-verbose-is-ok]]
= The Document Title
----

If you are including the document inside another document and you need to push the headings down to the right level in the output, the +leveloffset+ attribute is used.

Subsequent headings in a document should use the following syntax:

[source]
----
== Subheading

... content here ...

=== Subsubheading

content here ...

----

[[doc-guidelines-links]]
== Links

When you need to link to other parts of the manual you use the target id.
To use a target id you follow this syntax:

[source]
----
<<doc-guidelines-links>>
----

This will render as: <<doc-guidelines-links>>

[NOTE]
To use the target id in you document simply write the target id in your text, for example:

see \<<target-id>>

this should suffice for most cases.

If you need to link to another document with your own link text, then follow this procedure:

[source]
----
<<target-id, link text that fits in the context>>
----

NOTE: Having lots of linked text may work well in a web context but is a distracting in print.
The documentation we are creating is intended for both mediums so be considerate of this in your usage.

If you wish to use an external link, they are are added as:

[source]
----
http://www.opennms.org/[Link text here]
----

This will render in the output as: http://www.opennms.org/[Link text here]

For short links it may be beneficial not to use accompanying link text:

[source]
----
http://www.opennms.org/
----

Which renders as: http://www.opennms.org/

NOTE: It is acceptable to have a period trailing after the URL, it will not render as a part of the link.

[[doc-guideline-admonitions-notes]]
== Admonitions and useful notes

These are useful for defining specific sections, such as Notes, Tips and Important information.
We encourage the use of them in the documentation as long as they are used appropriately.
Choose from the following:

.Source template for making a note for additional hints
[source]
----
NOTE: This is my note.
----

This is how its rendered:

NOTE: This is my note.

.Source for giving a tip
[source]
----
TIP: This is my tip.
----

This is how its rendered:

TIP: This is my tip.

.Source for giving a important hint
[source]
----
IMPORTANT: This is my important hint.
----

This is how its rendered:

IMPORTANT: This is my important hint.

.Source for giving a caution
[source]
----
CAUTION: This is my caution.
----

This is how its rendered:

CAUTION: This is my caution.

.Source for giving a warning
[source]
----
WARNING: This is my warning.
----

This is how its rendered:

WARNING: This is my warning.

A multiline variation:

[source]
----
[TIP]
Tiptext. +
Line 2.
----

Which is rendered as:

[TIP]
Tiptext. +
Line 2.

NOTE: Remember to write these in full caps. There is no easy manner in which to add new admonitions, do not create your own.

== Attributes

Common attributes you can use in documents:

* \{opennms-version} - rendered as "{opennms-version}"

These can substitute part of URLs that point to, for example, APIdocs or source code.
Note that opennms-git-tag also handles the case of snapshot/master.

Sample Asciidoc attributes which can be used:

* \{docdir} - root directory of the documents
* \{nbsp} - non-breaking space

== Comments

There's a separate build that includes comments.
When the comments are used they show up with a yellow background.
This build doesn't run by default, but after a normal build, you can use `make annotated` to create a build yourself.
You can use the resulting 'annotated' page to search for content as the full manual is a single page.

To write a comment:

[source]
----
// this is a comment
----

Comments are not visible in the standard build.
Comment blocks won't be included in the output of any build.
The syntax for a comment block is:

[source]
----
////
Note that includes in here will still be processed, but not make it into the output.
That is, missing includes here will still break the build!
////
----

== Tables
For representing structured information you can use tables.
A table is constructed in the following manner:

[source]
----
[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Parameter     | Description                | Required | Default value
| `myFirstParm` | my first long description  | required | `myDefault`
| `myScndParm`  | my second long description | required | `myDefault`
|===
----

This is rendered as:

[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Parameter     | Description                | Required | Default value
| `myFirstParm` | my first long description  | required | `myDefault`
| `myScndParm`  | my second long description | required | `myDefault`
|===

NOTE: Please align your columns in the AsciiDoc source in order to give better readability when editing in text view.
If you have a very long description, break at 120 characters and align the text to improve source readability.

.Example in AsciiDoc source for very long table descriptions
image::../images/01_long-table-formatting.png[]

this is rendered as:

[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Parameter              | Description                                                                                 | Required | Default value
| `basic-authentication` | Authentication credentials to perform basic authentication.
                           Credentials should comply to http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1945.txt[RFC1945] section 11.1,
                           without the Base64 encoding part. That's: be a string made of the concatenation of: +
                           1- the user ID; +
                           2- a colon; +
                           3- the password. +
                          `basic-authentication` takes precedence over the `user` and `password` parameters.           | optional | `-`
| `header[0-9]+`         | Additional headers to be sent along with the request. Example of valid parameter's names are
                           `header0`, `header1` and `header180`. `header` is *not* a valid parameter name.            | optional | `-`
|===
