==== DDNS Adapter

The Opposite end of _Provisiond_ integration from the DNS Requisition Import, is the _DDNS adapter_.
This adapter uses the _dynamic DNS protocol_ to update a DNS system as nodes are provisioned into {opennms-product-name}.
To configure this adapter, edit the `opennms.properties` file and set the `importer.adapter.dns.server property`:

 importer.adapter.dns.server=192.168.1.1
