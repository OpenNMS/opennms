== What's New in OpenNMS Horizon 24

=== System Requirements

* *Java 8 through 11*: OpenNMS Horizon 24 requires at least Java 8 as the runtime environment and now supports running on JDK 11 as well.
  To run Horizon 24, we recommend the most recent version of Oracle JDK 8 for your platform, or the latest OpenJDK 11.
* *PostgreSQL 9 or higher*: Horizon 24 requires Any supported version PostgreSQL 9 or higher.
  As of this writing, PostgreSQL 9.3 is the earliest version under active support, but OpenNMS is known to work with at least PostgreSQL 9.1 and up.

=== Breaking Changes

==== Package Dependencies

The dependencies for the OpenNMS packages have changed such that the JDK is no longer a hard dependency of the `opennms-core` (RPM) or `libopennms-java` and `libopennmsdeps-java` (Debian/Ubuntu).  This allows you to install OpenNMS without package management forcing an install of a particular JDK, if you wish to run an alternate JDK or a JDK installed from tarball rather than packaging.

The `opennms` packages are a convenience wrapper that depend on a JDK for runtime to give you a simple starting point if you don't care which JDK you use.

==== Karaf Container

The embedded Karaf has been upgraded to 4.2.

This changes the default `users.properties` file.
Ensure that the `admingroup` in `${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/users.properties` contains the role `ssh`.
You can use the link:https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms/blob/c51bddef095a0ad23e31be13c241dc9d862950b7/container/karaf/src/main/filtered-resources/etc/users.properties[new default users.properties file] for comparison.

Other notable Karaf and OSGi-related changes include:

* We now support link:https://issues.opennms.org/browse/HZN-1436[adding OSGi-capable code at runtime] by putting a `.kar` file in the `deploy/` directory and adding relevant features to boot files in `etc/featuresBoot.d/`.
* The usage of `config:edit` has changed in some cases.
  This affects all configuration edits, where the configuration contains a `-`, e.g. `org.opennms.features.telemetry.listeners-udp-50003`.
  If you are using Minion or Sentinel, you will most likely be affected (e.g. for Telemetry Listeners/Adapters).
+
For example, this set of configuration commands:
+
----
config:edit org.opennms.features.telemetry.listeners-udp-50003
config:property-set key value
config:update
----
+
...should now be written as:
+
----
config:edit --alias udp-50003 --factory org.opennms.features.telemetry.listeners
config:property-set key value
config:update
----

==== Flows

===== Flows Grouped By Conversation

Flows are now grouped by conversations using applications instead of ports.
This changes the way statistics about flows are presented and grouped.

Thus, the elasticsearch storage has changed and old data must be converted to the new format.
To adopt existing flows, the following command can be used (please be aware that this can take a long time and put your CPU and disk under high stress):

[source,shell]
----
curl -v -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' "http://${ES_HOST}:${ES_PORT}/netflow-*/_update_by_query?refresh=true" -d @- << EOF
{
  "script": {
    "lang": "painless",
    "source": "ctx._source['netflow.convo_key'] = '[\"' + ctx._source['location'] + '\",' + ctx._source['netflow.protocol'] + ',\"' + ((Objects.compare(ctx._source['netflow.src_addr'], ctx._source['netflow.src_addr'], String::compareTo) < 0) ? ctx._source['netflow.src_addr'] : ctx._source['netflow.dst_addr']) + '\",\"' + ((Objects.compare(ctx._source['netflow.src_addr'], ctx._source['netflow.src_addr'], String::compareTo) < 0) ? ctx._source['netflow.dst_addr'] : ctx._source['netflow.src_addr']) + '\",' + ((ctx._source['netflow.application'] != null) ? ('\"' + ctx._source['netflow.application'] + '\"') : 'null') + ']'"
  },
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}
EOF
----

===== Telemetryd Configuration Format Change

Since we have added support for more dynamic telemetryd configurations to support more complex listeners and adapters, the configuration format for telemetryd has changed.

The new configuration defines listeners containing parsers and queues containing adapters which are linked by the queues name.

For example, this old configuration:

```
<telemetryd-config>
  <protocol name="Netflow-5" description="Listener for Netflow 5 UDP packets" enabled="false">
    <listener name="Netflow-5-UDP-8877" class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.telemetry.listeners.udp.UdpListener">
      <parameter key="port" value="8877"/>
    </listener>

    <adapter name="Netflow-5-Parser" class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.telemetry.adapters.netflow.v5.Netflow5Adapter">
    </adapter>
  </protocol>
</telemetryd-config>
```

...should now be written as:

```
<telemetryd-config>
  <listener name="Netflow-5-UDP-8877" class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.telemetry.listeners.UdpListener" enabled="false">
    <parameter key="port" value="8877"/>

    <parser name="Netflow-5-Parser" class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.telemetry.protocols.netflow.parser.Netflow5UdpParser" queue="Netflow-5" />
  </listener>

  <queue name="Netflow-5">
    <adapter name="Netflow-5-Adapter" class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.telemetry.protocols.netflow.adapter.netflow5.Netflow5Adapter" enabled="false">
    </adapter>
  </queue>
</telemetryd-config>
```

As you can see, the ``listener``s become independent elements which contain ``parser``s whereas the ``protocol``s are renamed to ``queue``s.
Each parser must reference a queue by name to define which adapters are used to pick up the parsed data.

In addition, the listener configuration for minions has changed.
The new minion configuration looks like the following and adapts the same set of structural changes:

```
admin@minion()> config:edit --alias Netflow-5-UDP-8877 --factory org.opennms.features.telemetry.listeners
admin@minion()> config:property-set name Netflow-5-UDP-8877
admin@minion()> config:property-set class-name org.opennms.netmgt.telemetry.listeners.UdpListener
admin@minion()> config:property-set parameters.port 8877
admin@minion()> config:property-set parser.0.name Netflow-5-Parser
admin@minion()> config:property-set parser.0.queue Netflow-5
```

==== Plugins, Parsers, and Services

* *Cassandra JMX*: The `cassandra30x.xml` datacollection config for thread pool metrics has been modified to be of type `counter` rather than type `gauge`.  If you are using RRD or JRobin storage, you will need to delete any `.jrb` or `.rrd` files with both `path_request` and `CurrentlyBlockedTasks` in their filename (eg, `org_apache_cassandra_metrics_type_ThreadPools_path_request_scope_MutationStage_name_CurrentlyBlockedTasks.jrb`).
* *Pollerd and Collectd*: Additional attributes for thread pool graphs have been added to the Pollerd and Collectd mbeans.
  If you are using `storeByGroup=true` with RRD or JRobin, you will need to delete the `OpenNMS_Name_Pollerd` and `OpenNMS_Name_Collectd` `.jrb` or `.rrd` files and let them be reinitialized.
  Newts and `storeByGroup=false` should be unaffected.
* *Dhcpd*: The _Dhcpd_ plugin (and its configuration) was removed in favor of a Minion-capable implementation.
  The new _DhcpMonitor_ options can be set in the `poller-configuration.xml` file.
* *Syslog*: The default parser used for _Syslog_ messages has been switched from the `CustomSyslogParser` to the `RadixTreeSyslogParser`.
* *Plugins*: The _Plugin Manager_ is no longer distributed with OpenNMS.
  Features or bundles should be installed via the Karaf Shell.

==== Removed from Horizon 24

* The Centric Trouble Ticketer plugin has been removed.
* The NCS-Alarm page and the NCS-Topology-Plugin have been removed. See issue link:https://issues.opennms.org/browse/HZN-1422[HZN-1422].
* The remote poller map has been removed.

==== Developer Considerations

* The `HttpService` can no longer be consumed.
  This will only affect custom implementations of HTTP Servlets and Resources, but only if they are exposed via `httpServices.register(...)`.
  If you need those, please expose the according services via the OSGi Service Registration.
  Refer to the link:https://osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/7.0.0/service.http.whiteboard.html[OSGi Http Whiteboard Specification] for more details.

* Exposing Servlets now follow the OSGi Specification.
  Refer to the  link:https://osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/7.0.0/service.http.whiteboard.html[OSGi Http Whiteboard Specification] for more details.

* Properties to expose Vaadin Applications have changed:
  ** `init.widgetset` becomes `servlet.init.widgetset`
  ** `alias` becomes `osgi.http.whiteboard.servlet.pattern`


=== New Features and Improvements

==== Correlation (ALEC, formerly OCE/Sextant)

The correlation feature introduced in Horizon 23 has been vastly improved and given a new name: ALEC (Architecture for Learning Enabled Correlation).  Detailed documentation is available at link:https://alec.opennms.com/[the ALEC site].

It has a ton of bugfixes, as well as a host of new features, including:

* Smart propagation of acknowledgements.
* Support for embedding directly in OpenNMS's Karaf.
* ML-guided alarm correlation using Tensorflow.
* APIs for user feedback training, including root cause (support for feedback will be a part of a future Helm release)
* The web UI has been updated to show and filter situations in the alarm browser, and outstanding situations show on the front page.

==== Events and Alarms

* The event correlator now supports a `default` parameter on `<assignment>` tags as a fallback when a value cannot be generated.
* Event XML files now support an optional `<priority>` tag to allow easier customization/overriding of default events.
* Syslogd can now be optionally configured to include the raw syslog message in resulting events as a parameter.

==== Datacollection, Thresholding, and Reporting

* `ssCpuRawSteal`, `ssCpuRawGuest`, `ssCpuRawGuestNice`, and `ssCpuNumCpus` are now supported from Net-SNMP agents version 5.7.3 and higher.
* A number of new views have been added to the database to facilitate SQL-based reporting:
  ** `node_categories`: Nodes with categories
  ** `node_alarms`: Alarm status from nodes and allow filtering on categories
  ** `node_outages`: Outages of nodes and allow filtering on categories
  ** `node_ip_services`: Denormalise Nodes and IP services
* *SnmpCollectorNG*: An alternative to the SnmpCollector has been added which implements the internal `CollectionSet` APIs and is meant to eventually replace the existing SnmpCollector.

==== Karaf Command Line

A number of Karaf commands have been added or updated:

* `enlinkd:generate-topology`: generates a test topology
* `enlinkd:delete-topology`: delete generated topology
* `events:show-event-config`: dumps events to XML (including those read from `eventconf.xml` as well as OSGi plugins that provide event configuration)
* `kafka-producer:push-topology-edges`: push topology edges to a Kafka topic
* `meta:test`: test a node/interface metadata query

==== Node and Interface Metadata

There is now experimental support for associating arbitrary metadata with nodes and interfaces.  A full user-facing interface to configuring metadata in the provisioning UI should be available by Horizon 25.

In this release, there is no default metadata being collected, but there is a ReST interface to manipulate metadata, and metadata can be assigned to nodes and interfaces in requisitions.

For details on using the metadata APIs, see link:http://docs.opennms.org/opennms/releases/24.0.0/guide-admin/guide-admin.html#ga-meta-data[the Admin Guide] and link:http://docs.opennms.org/opennms/releases/24.0.0/guide-development/guide-development.html#_meta_data[the Developer Guide].

==== Provisioning

A new adapter (`WsManAssetProvisioningAdapter`) has been added which can update asset information during provisioning based on WS-Man data.  (Note: It does not currently support running on Minions.)

==== ReST

* *Measurements*: Resource metadata is now returned along with measurements results.
* *Topology*: User Defined Links (`/opennms/api/v2/userdefinedlinks`)
+
Support was added for user defined links (UDLs) in the Enhanced Linkd topology.
Users may now programitically (using the REST API) create "manual" links between node and have them appear in the topology UI.

==== Topology and Business Services

* Enlinkd and other topology information have been refactored into a more generalized graph service that also includes other information like ALEC alarm and situation topology.
  This also means that topology data can be sent to Kafka alongside nodes, events, and alarms.
* *Performance*: Huge improvements have been made to performance in Enhanced Linkd, including responsiveness of the Topology web UI.
* *BSM*: Applications can now be added as an edge to a Business Service.  This allows you to aggregate IP services.

==== Web UI

The web UI has gone through a major refresh.
The HTML has been simplified, the UI wastes less space, and the login page features a fancy new look featuring our mascot, Ulf. ;)

* *Notifications*: Browser notifications are now supported in the Web UI.
  The browser notification can be added to a notification path and desktop notifications will pop-up for currently logged in users if a notice is delivered.
* *Sessions*: Browser session timeout is now disabled by default.

==== Geocoder Services

The _Geocoder Service_s have been reworked and must be re-configured.
The recommended way for this is to delete all `etc/org.opennms.features.geocoder*.cfg` files and
Navigate the `Configure Geocoder Services` page from the Admin page and configure the _Geocoder Service_ of your choice.

==== Other Core Changes

Support was added for OpenTracing distributed tracing for RPC/Sink requests.

==== Developer APIs

A new API ("OpenNMS Integration API") has been introduced that presents a simplified interface to a number of integration points including subscribing to events and alarms, writing custom detectors and pollers, and more.
