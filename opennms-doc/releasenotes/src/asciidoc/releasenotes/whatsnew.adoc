== What's New in OpenNMS Horizon 27

=== System Requirements

* *Java 8 through 11*: OpenNMS Horizon 27 runs on JDK 8 through 11.
  We recommend the most recent version of OpenJDK 11.
* *PostgreSQL 10 or higher*: Horizon 27 requires any supported version of PostgreSQL from 10 up to (and including) 13.

== Breaking Changes

=== Remote Poller Removed

The remote poller has been removed from Horizon 27.
It has been replaced with new infrastructure for <<Application Perspective Monitoring,perspective-based monitoring>> that runs on Minions.

=== VMware Assets

VMware-related data is not longer stored in node assets.
The `install` command will move any existing VMware asset data to the node's metadata when you upgrade.

== New Features and Improvements

=== Karaf Shell

A number of useful commands have been added or updated in the Karaf shell.

* `alarm-list`: list current alarms (optionally filtered by UEI)
* `event-list`: list events (optionally filtered by UEI)
* `ip-addr-range`: generate a list of IP addresses to use in other commands
* `reload-daemon`: now accepts an optional configuration file to target for reload
* `send-event`: additional options supported to match the CLI version of `send-event` more closely
* `snmp-fit`: can now optionally send a `newSuspect` event on success
* `snmp-get`: like `snmp-walk`, but fetches a single MIB object and prints the result

=== Minion and Sentinel

* The Minion `confd` configuration support now handles a bunch more options, including setting Jetty, RMI, and ssh host and port, Secure Credentials Vault configuration, and environment variables and options for the JVM.  For details, see link:https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms/blob/develop/opennms-container/minion/CONFD_README.md[the CONFD_README file].
* It's now possible to override entries in a Sentinel's `system.properties` with a file called `custom.system.properties`

=== Application Perspective Monitoring

Application Perspective Monitoring replaces the old Remote Poller.

It uses the Minion infrastructure to monitor a service's availability from these different perspectives.
When a service is not responsive an outage will be generated with the corresponding perspective.

A number of provisioning, polling, and web UI changes have been made to accomodate this new infrastructure.

=== Provisioning

* Node scan has been updated to limit the number of concurrent RPC requests so as not to overload communication with Minions.
* New policies have been added for creating node and interface metadata during provisioning.

=== Polling and Monitoring

* WMI/SMB support has been updated to use a wider set of encryption types.
* Data collection configuration has been added for Netscaler vServer.

=== Thresholding

* It is now possible to use metadata in threshold evaluation.

=== RPC, Telemetry, Flows, and BMP

* Improvements have been made for supporting aggregate flow metrics.
* Flow DNS enrichment has been enhanced to improve performance.
* Aggregate flow queries now support resolving hostnames if available.
* Sink RPC APIs have been enhanced to expose metrics to Karaf for tracing and performance tuning.
* The OpenConfig integration now supports gNMI, in addition to JTI.

=== Notifications

* It is now possible to use node-, interface-, and service-level metadata in notifications.

=== ReST API

* Events for `applicationCreated`/`applicationDeleted` are now sent when applications are added or removed through the ReST API.
* A new v2 API for retrieving application status has been added.

=== Web UI Improvements

* A new universal search bar has been added which allows for searching alarms, nodes, and more from the top of any page in the UI.

=== Documentation Updates

Documentation improvements and additions have been made in a number of areas:

* Application Perspective Monitoring
* Data Collection Configuration
* Metadata
* Mail Transport Monitor
* Minion/Kafka RPC Tuning
* Provisioning
* Thresholding
* Users Configuration, Duty Schedules, and Security Roles

...plus TONS of smaller readability improvements.

== Important Internal Changes

* Sink internals have been updated to use Protobuf 3.
