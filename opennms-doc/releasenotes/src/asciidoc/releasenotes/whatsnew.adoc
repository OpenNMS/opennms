== What's New in OpenNMS Horizon 24

* Added support for browser notifications to notifd.
  The browser notification can be added to a notification path and desktop notifications will pop-up for currently logged in users if a notice is delivered.

=== System Requirements

* *Java 8*: OpenNMS Horizon 24 requires Java 8 as the runtime environment.
  To run Horizon 24, we recommend the most recent version of Oracle JDK 8 for your platform.
* *PostgreSQL 9 or higher*: Horizon 24 requires Any supported version PostgreSQL 9 or higher.
  As of this writing, PostgreSQL 9.3 is the earliest version under active support, but OpenNMS is known to work with at least PostgreSQL 9.1 and up.

=== Breaking Changes

* Flows are grouped by conversations using applications instead of ports.
  This changes the way statistics about flows are presented and grouped.
  Therefore the elasticsearch storage has changed and old data must be converted to the new format.
  To adopt existing flows, the following command can be used (please be aware that this can take a long time and put your CPU and disk under high stress):
```
curl -v -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' "http://${ES_HOST}:${ES_PORT}/netflow-*/_update_by_query?refresh=true" -d @- << EOF
{
  "script": {
    "lang": "painless",
    "source": "ctx._source['netflow.convo_key'] = '[\"' + ctx._source['location'] + '\",' + ctx._source['netflow.protocol'] + ',\"' + ((Objects.compare(ctx._source['netflow.src_addr'], ctx._source['netflow.src_addr'], String::compareTo) < 0) ? ctx._source['netflow.src_addr'] : ctx._source['netflow.dst_addr']) + '\",\"' + ((Objects.compare(ctx._source['netflow.src_addr'], ctx._source['netflow.src_addr'], String::compareTo) < 0) ? ctx._source['netflow.dst_addr'] : ctx._source['netflow.src_addr']) + '\",' + ((ctx._source['netflow.application'] != null) ? ('\"' + ctx._source['netflow.application'] + '\"') : 'null') + ']'"
  },
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}
EOF
```
