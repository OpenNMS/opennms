=== Important Upgrade Notes

* *Simple Topology Provider*: The Simple Topology Provider has been removed. A new GraphML Topology Provider is introduced and should be used instead.
* *Cassandra JMX Metrics*: The default value for the `friendly-name` attribute on the `JMX-Cassandra` collection service has changed from `cassandra21x` to `cassandra`.
This changes the path in which the metrics are stored.
If you have already been collecting these metrics and wish to preserve them, you can ignore this change when merging your configuration.
* *Jetty 9.3.x Upgrade*: Jetty has been upgraded from `8.1.x` to the latest `9.3.x`.
If you have a custom `jetty.xml` in your `etc` folder, you will need to migrate your changes.
Use `etc/examples/jetty.xml` as a starting point.
* *Drools 6.4.0 Upgrade*: Drools has been upgraded from `6.0.1.Final` to `6.4.0.Final`.
If you have custom Drools rules, they may need to be revised.
The compiler used in `6.4.0` is stricter than the compiler in previous versions.

=== New Features
* GraphML Topology Provider: A new Topology Provider which reads GraphML formatted graphs and displays them in the the Topology UI.
