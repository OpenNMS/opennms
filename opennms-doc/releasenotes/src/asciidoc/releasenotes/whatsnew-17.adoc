== What's New in OpenNMS 17

=== System Requirements

* *Java 8*: OpenNMS 17 requires Java 8 as the runtime environment.
  To run OpenNMS 17, we recommend the most recent version of Oracle JDK 8 for your platform.
* *PostgreSQL 9.1 or higher*: OpenNMS 17 now requires PostgreSQL 9.1 or higher.
  All older versions of PostgreSQL are past their end-of-life support date.

=== Important Upgrade Notes

* *Clean Up Events and Alarms*: Please clean up your event and alarm lists as much as possible before performing an upgrade to OpenNMS 17.
  The upgrade process contains a large number of database schema migrations which will cause rewrites of all of the data in some tables.
  If you prune unused data from these tables beforehand, it will make the upgrade process much quicker.
* *Remote Poller API Change*: Due to internal API changes, the Remote Poller API has changed in OpenNMS 17.
  If you upgrade to OpenNMS 17, you will also need to upgrade all Remote Pollers attached to the system to version 17 as well.
* *RMI Security Updates*: Since OpenNMS 16.0.4, the RMI registry has been changed to only listen on localhost by default.
  Starting in OpenNMS 17, it also now requires authentication using an OpenNMS administrator account.
* *JMX Updates*: JMX is no longer enabled by default on port 18980.
  If you have reason to access your OpenNMS instance remotely over JMX, you can reenable it by adding `-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=18980` and `-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false` to `ADDITIONAL_MANAGER_OPTIONS` in `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/opennms.conf`.
  Note that OpenNMS-JVM monitoring of the local instance (ie, localhost) will still work by using the JMX Access API, without needing to enable the TCP port.

=== API Changes

* Monitoring locations for the Remote Poller are now viewed and configured in the UI under `/locations/index.jsp`.
  Monitoring locations were previously configured in the `etc/monitoring-locations.xml` file but are now stored in `monitoringlocations` database table.
* All data previously in the `location_monitors` table is now in the `monitoringsystems` table.
* The `ifIndex` column has been removed from the `ipInterface` table.
  To fetch the ifIndex, you need to join to the `snmpInterface` table by `nodeId`.
* The `nodeId` and `ipAddr` columns have been removed from the `ifServices` table.
  To fetch these columns, you need to join to the `ipInterface` table.
* The `nodeId`, `ipAddr` and `serviceId` columns have been removed from the `outages` table.
  To fetch these columns, you need to join to the `ifServices` table.

=== New Features

* *Newts Storage for Data Collection*: In addition to RRD and JRobin, OpenNMS 17 data collection now supports our [Newts](http://opennms.github.io/newts/) time-series data store that uses the highly-scalable Apache Cassandra database as the storage backend.
  This storage solution provides higher performance than the file-based RRD and JRobin databases and practically unlimited scalability when using a cluster of Cassandra nodes.
  You can drastically reduce CPU and storage load on your OpenNMS system and increase the number of metrics stored per second by using the Newts storage engine.
* *Measurements REST API Filtering*: The measurements REST API now supports the use of arithmetic filters on the returned datasets.
  This allows you to perform calculations or statistical operations on the data via server-side processing.
* *Grafana Panel*: An optional panel has been added to the UI to allow you to integrate links to Grafana graphs in the UI.
* *Streamlined UI Style*: The style of the UI has been refined to provide a clearer, more modern look-and-feel.
* *Alarm Heatmap*: A heatmap visualization has been added that lets you quickly visualize alarm status and outages within a category or on a node.
* *FreeIPA Kerberos Authentication*: We've added a sample configuration for FreeIPA Kerberos SSO to our `jetty-webapps/opennms/WEB-INF/spring-security.d` directory.
* *JMX Configuration UI and CLI*: The JMX Configuration web UI and CLI have been rewritten to make it easier to generate complex JMX data collection configurations.
* *JMS Alarm Northbounder*: The implementation of a JMS northbounder for sending OpenNMS Alarms to external JMS listeners has been completed. Thanks to David Schlenk (@dschlenk) for this contribution!
* *OTRS 3.1+ Ticketing Integration*: Our OTRS ticketing integration has been updated to work with the API in OTRS 3.1 and higher. Thanks to Jonathan Sartin (@blackpoplar) for this contribution!
* *Easier Remote Poller Configuration*: Monitoring locations can now be associated with multiple polling and collection packages. This can make some Remote Poller scenarios easier to configure.

=== Dependency Updates

* Jasper Reports has been upgraded from 5.6.1 to 6.1.1.

=== Retired Features

* *Linkd*: Linkd was the original implementation of the link scanning daemon for OpenNMS. It has been superseded by Enhanced Linkd (Enlinkd) in OpenNMS 14 and higher. Linkd has been removed as of OpenNMS 17.
* *SVG Maps*: The SVG map feature relied on Linkd's code for drawing links between items on the map so it was also removed in OpenNMS 17.
* *Xmlrpcd*: Xmlrpcd was a daemon that relayed inventory and polling events to an external system over the XML-RPC protocol. Because you can accomplish almost all of its use cases by using the provisioning REST service, it has been removed.
* *MX4J*: The MX4J HTTP interface has been removed in favor of using more modern JMX access methods that have been added in recent versions of the JVM.

=== Internal Updates

* The Enlinkd link scanning code and topology code have been updated to provide higher performance.
* The resource API for data storage has undergone heavy refactoring to provide changes necessary to support Newts.
* The Jasper and statsd reports have been changed so that they use a new unified interface for fetching data from either RRD, JRobin, or Newts.
* The Discovery engine has been refactored into its own project.
* The REST interface has been refactored to be based on Apache CXF 3.1.4.
* The Dashboard has been rewritten using the Vaadin toolkit to modernize its look-and-feel.
* The `opennms-assemblies/jmx-config-generator-onejar` project has been moved to `features/jmx-config-generator`.

=== Documentation

* Introducing installation guide for Debian, CentOS and Windows-based systems.
* Introducing installation guide for Newts.
* Documentation for JasperReports for using the Measurements ReST API added to the admin guide.
* Documentation for Enhanced Linkd daemon configuration and collected information for Bridge-MIB discovery, LLDP, CDP, OSPF and IS-IS added to the admin guide.
* Documentation for how to deal with SSL in Java and Jetty added to the admin guide.
