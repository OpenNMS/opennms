=== What's New in Meridian 2020

Since Meridian 2019, we have refined a number of the features introduced relating to telemetry, correlation, and other underlying APIs.

Meridian 2020 roughly matches the feature set available in Horizon 26.

==== Documentation Updates

Documentation improvements have been made in a number of areas:

* Docker
* Grafana PDF Reports
* Graph Service API
* Minion
* Telemetry/flows
* Thresholding
* Timeseries Integration

==== Graph API

A new API has been added for querying graph data, inspired by link:http://graphml.graphdrawing.org[GraphML].
This API consolidates a number of internal APIs for accessing topology, application, BSM, link, and other data.

==== Kafka and RPC

The RPC APIs for communicating between the OpenNMS core, Minion, and Sentinel have been improved, including adding support for gRPC communication.

It is now possible to configure Kafka to use a single topic for communication rather than one-per-module.

Flow data can now be configured to be enriched with node metadata before being forwarded to Kafka.

==== Minion and Sentinel

* The Minion can now be configured using `confd` by creating a `minion-config.yaml` file.
For details, see link:https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms/blob/develop/opennms-container/minion/CONFD_README.md[the README in the Minion source].
* The Minion Docker container has a number of enhancements:
** Minion container sizes have been halved.
** Native ICMP support has been added to improve performance.
** Dockerized Minion now supports ARM.
* The Jolokia HTTP-JMX bridge has been added to the Minion and Sentinel.

==== Polling and Monitoring

* The HTTP POST monitor has been updated to support injecting headers into the request.
* The poller now does a better job of validating configs on startup/reload.

==== Provisioning

* Provisiond has been enhanced to improve performance of scans.
* Nodes provisioned through new suspect events now get assigned a foreign source.

==== Telemetry and BMP

* The flow classification editor now supports CIDR notation for IP address expressions.
* Support has been added for the BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP).

==== Time-Series API

A new experimental internal API has been added for supporting persisting time-series data in a way that doesn't carry the baggage of the existing persistence APIs which are still heavily influenced by RRDTool.

==== Web UI Improvements

* The navbar notification alert now shows everywhere, not just the front page.
* The "user" menu has been reorganized and cleaned up.
* The requisitions UI now supports deleting a node from its node page in the editor.

=== Breaking Changes

==== Flow Classification

In Meridian 2019, the Flow Classification UI accepted invalid IP address values, e.g., `10,192.1,168.1,5.1-160`.
When upgrading {opennms-product-name}, existing Flow Classification Rules may be considered invalid. In this case they are silently ignored by the Flo
w Classification Engine.

In order to assure no invalid Flow Classification Rules exist, please run the OSGi shell command `opennms-classification:list-invalid-rules` to list a
ll invalid rules.
If there are any invalid rules, you must manually fix them using the Flow Classification UI.
For more details, refer to issue https://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-12422[NMS-12422].

==== Events and Kafka

Events forwarded to Kafka  are now keyed by `id` rather than `uei`.

==== Karaf Shell Command Changes

All of the custom Karaf shell commands have now been updated to use a common scope of `opennms`.
This makes it easier to find and enumerate the commands.

Mapping from previous to new commands is as follows:

|===

=== Notable Internal Changes

* Kafka has been updated to version 2.4.0.
* Protobuf has been updated to version 3.11.4.
* The OpenNMS Integration API is now version 0.4.
* Internally, events are, in most cases, immutable.
For the most part, you should see no changes in the external and code places that events are interacted with.
They are converted to mutable versions in places where they are often manipulated (like Drools).

=== Other Improvements

Since Meridian 2020 is based on Horizon 26, it contains all the fixes and updates that have occurred since Meridian 2019 was created from the Horizon 25 codebase.
