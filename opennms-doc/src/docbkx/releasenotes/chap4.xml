  <title>Supported Systems</title>

  <subtitle>Supported UNIX-like OSes</subtitle>

  <para>OpenNMS is written almost entirely in Java, and should be able to run
  on any system that suuports the Java 1.4 Virtual Machine. There are
  requirements for other programs such as PostgreSQL, Perl, RRDTool and
  Tomcat4, but the 1.4 JDK is the key requirement (as most of the other
  packages can be compiled from source).</para>

  <para>The following are the systems that support or are known to run
  OpenNMS.</para>

  <section id="chap4sect1">
    <title>Fully Supported</title>

    <para>The following Linux distributions and other unix-like systems are
    supported out-of-the-box with native installation packages.</para>

    <bridgehead>Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and Red
    Hat Enterprise Linux 5</bridgehead>

    <bridgehead>CentOS 3, CentOS 4 and CentOS 5</bridgehead>

      <title>Debian</title>

      <para>
        Debian stable (1.2.x) packages (for Sarge and later) are available
        at the following apt-repository:
        <programlisting>deb http://debian.opennms.org/ stable main</programlisting>

      <para>
        Debian unstable (1.3.x) packages (for Etch and later) are available

    <formalpara>
      <title>MacOSX 10.4 (Tiger)</title>

      <para>On MacOSX, the Fink distribution packages of OpenNMS are
      supported. See <ulink url="http://www.finkproject.org/">the Fink web
      site</ulink> for more information on installing and using Fink.</para>
    </formalpara>

    <para>Also note that on MacOSX, PostgreSQL must be configured in the same
    manner as above for Linux. <emphasis>However</emphasis>, to do so you will
    need to update the SHM settings so that the OS allows enough resources for
    PostgreSQL to run with larger buffers.</para>

    <para>There are details for configuring the shared memory segments on
    <ulink url="http://wiki.finkproject.org/index.php/Shared_Memory_Regions_on_Darwin">the
    Fink wiki</ulink>.</para>

    <title>Officially Unsupported</title>

    <para>OpenNMS 1.3.2 requires Java 5 (a 1.5 JDK), Tomcat 5.5, RRDTool 1.2
    and PostgreSQL 7.4. Any operating system that can support these
    dependencies should be able to run OpenNMS. However, since a lot of the
    older distributions do not support packages for these applications it will
    be much harder to get them installed, and so they are not officially
    supported.</para>

    <para>A number of distributions that used to be supported are still able
    to run OpenNMS but are not officially supported:</para>

    <formalpara>
      <title>Mandrake</title>

      <para>OpenNMS should run on Mandrake, and official Mandriva support is
      expected for OpenNMS 2.0.</para>
