					Before you start, you may want to install the yum-fastestmirror RPM if your distro

				<title>Install the OpenNMS Repository RPM</title>
				
				<para>
					To simplify installation through Yum, we've created an RPM that contains the configuration
					necessary for Yum to be able to find the other OpenNMS packages.  Based on the release you
					chose in the section above, choose the approprate RPM from the <ulink
					url="http://yum.opennms.org/">OpenNMS Yum Repository</ulink>.
				</para>
				
				<para>
					For example, to install the latest snapshot release on Fedora 7, you would run:
					<programlisting>rpm -Uvh http://yum.opennms.org/repofiles/opennms-repo-snapshot-fc7.noarch.rpm</programlisting>
				</para>

				<para>
					Or, to install the latest unstable release on CentOS or RHEL 5, you would run:
					<programlisting>rpm -Uvh http://yum.opennms.org/repofiles/opennms-repo-unstable-rhel5.noarch.rpm</programlisting>
				</para>

				<para>
					Now you should see OpenNMS packages available when you get a list of yum packages:
					<programlisting> [user@localhost]$ sudo yum list opennms
 ...
 Available Packages
 opennms.noarch                           1.5.96-1               opennms-unstable</programlisting>
 				</para>
 				
 				<note>
 					<para>
 						If you are using older yum-based distributions (like CentOS 3, for example), you may
 						need to append the yum configuration to <filename>/etc/yum.conf</filename>.  Older
 						versions of yum don't recognize <filename>/etc/yum.repos.d/</filename> as a valid
 						location for yum configuration.  You can fix this by using <filename>cat</filename>
 						to append the repository configurations to <filename>/etc/yum.conf</filename>:
 						<programlisting>[root@localhost]# cat /etc/yum.repos.d/* &gt;&gt; /etc/yum.conf</programlisting>

	<section id="java">
		<title>Prerequisite Package: Java</title>

		<para>
			OpenNMS is written mainly in Java, although there are a few JNI
			calls to some C code in order to implement things such as ICMP. and so it
			follows that Java would need to be installed.
 		</para>

		<para>
			OpenNMS requires Java SE 5.0 or higher (JDK 1.5). It is recommended that the
			JDK from Sun is used with OpenNMS. If OpenNMS is to be run on a 64-bit system,
			be sure to install the 64-bit JDK.
		</para>

		<section id="java-rpm">
			<title>Installing on RPM-based Distributions Using Yum</title>

			<para>
				The Sun JDK is available in our Yum repository.  If you have configured Yum
				as specified above, you just need to run:
				<programlisting>yum install jdk</programlisting>
			</para>
			
			<para>
				Because of a bug in the 64-bit RPM signing, if you are on x86_64, you will
				need to disable GPG checking.  You can do so with the <code>--nogpgcheck</code>
				option to yum:
				<programlisting>yum --nogpgcheck install jdk</programlisting>
			</para>

		<section id="java-debian">
			<title>Installing Java on Debian or Ubuntu</title>

			<para>
				<programlisting>apt-get install sun-java5-jdk</programlisting>

			<note>
				<para>

			<para>

		</para>

		<para>
			When installing OpenNMS, two things must happen. First, OpenNMS has
			to be able to contact the database over TCP/IP (even on localhost) and
			second, the installation process must be able to create the
			database.
		</para>

		<para>OpenNMS requires version 7.4 or later of PostgreSQL,

			<title>Adding the iplike function</title>

			<para>OpenNMS makes heavy use of a function called "iplike".
				Since it is
				written in C, it has been removed from the main OpenNMS code and placed
				in its own project.</para>

			<para>If a C-based iplike is not installed, the OpenNMS installer
				will
				add a version written in the PostgreSQL command language. It will work,
				but not as quickly as the compiled iplike will.</para>

			<para>To install iplike, simply download the proper package for
				your
				distribution. There should be a package for PostgreSQL versions 7.4-8.1,
				and one for 8.2+. In addition, there will be separate 32-bit and 64-bit
				versions. It is also possible to download a tarball and do the usual
				"configure", "make", and "make install". Once installed it should
				not be
				required to update it again.</para>
