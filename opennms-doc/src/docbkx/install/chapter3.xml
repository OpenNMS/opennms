				<glossdef>
					<para>OpenNMS configuration files.</para>
					<para>
						On some distributions, upstream changes in files in this directory
						are detected and means are provided for migrating those changes to
						the new release.
					</para>
					<para>
						On RPM-based distributions, if an OpenNMS configuration file has changed,
						RPM will create a "<filename>.rpmnew</filename>" file which contains the
						version of that configuration file that shipped with the new version of
						OpenNMS. You will need to look at the changes between your file
						and the new one and merge them manually, at the moment. The command
						"<code>diff -u &lt;old file&gt; &lt;new file&gt; | less</code>" can
						assist you in seeing what has changed.
					</para>
					<para>
						On Debian-based distributions, dpkg will automatically prompt you when
						a configuration file has changed upstream between versions, and will offer
						you a set of options to deal with it.
					</para>
				</glossdef>
			</glossentry>

			<glossentry>
				<glossterm><filename>$OPENNMS_HOME/share/rrd/</filename></glossterm>

				<glossdef>
					<para>
						RRD data files that store response time data and performance data collected
						from SNMP (and elsewhere).  The installer should not touch the RRD files in
						<filename>$OPENNMS_HOME/share/rrd</filename>.  Unless you are migrating from
						RRDTool to jRobin, you should not have to worry about them.

				<title>Prune Unneeded Events</title>
				
				<para>
					Should you not be doing this already, either using vacuumd or
					cron, prune away any unneeded events.  The events table will most
					probably be the largest, and there's no point backing up data that
					you don't need.
				</para>
				
				<para>
					For example, to delete any events older than 6 weeks that have no
					associated outages, you can run, from the <filename>psql</filename>

DELETE FROM events WHERE NOT EXISTS

				<title>Assess the Events Table Size</title>
				
				<para>
					If you have a large number of events, you may need to increase the amount
					of memory passed to the OpenNMS <filename>install</filename> tool.  For example,
					if you have 250k events, you will need almost 600MB of heap.  When the time comes
					to run the <filename>install</filename> tool, assuming you have enough available
					memory, it's probably safe to just use a very large value to pass to
					<filename>install</filename>, like:

		<title>Configure Java for OpenNMS</title>
