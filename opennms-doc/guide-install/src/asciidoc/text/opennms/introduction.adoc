== Basic Installation of OpenNMS

The _OpenNMS_ platform can be installed in several ways.
This guide describes the installation of the platform on _RHEL-_, _Debian-_ and _Microsoft Windows_ based operation systems.
Installable pre-compiled software packages are provided through _RPM_ and _Debian_ repository servers.
Running _OpenNMS_ requires the following components:

* Internet access to download and verify installation packages from public repository server
* Installed <<gi-install-oracle-java, Oracle Java 8>> environment
* PostgreSQL 9.1+ data base
* Set link to section which describes to install with RRDTool.
  Optional link:http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/[RRDtool] to persist long term performance data

NOTE: _OpenJDK 8_ can be used, but for production and critical environments _Oracle Java 8_ is recommended.

NOTE: `${OPENNMS_HOME}` is referred to the path _OpenNMS_ is installed to.
      On _RHEL-based_ systems it is `/opt/opennms` on _Debian-based_ systems it is `/usr/share/opennms`.
      The environment in _Microsoft Windows_ can refer to `C:\Program Files\opennms`

With the _opennms_ meta package all dependencies needed for the components mentioned above are maintained.
The following sections describe how to install _OpenNMS_ on a single system.
Dependencies for _Java_ and the _PostgreSQL_ data base are maintained with the _opennms_ meta installation package.

=== Repositories for Releases

Installation packages are available for different releases of _OpenNMS_.
The configuration of the repository decides which _OpenNMS_ release will be installed.

The following releases are available for installation:

To install a different release the repository files have to be installed and manually modified.

==== Specific Release on RHEL-based system

.Installation of release specific repositories
[source, shell]
----
rpm -Uvh http://yum.opennms.org/repofiles/opennms-repo-${RELEASE}-rhel7.noarch.rpm<1>
rpm --import http://yum.opennms.org/OPENNMS-GPG-KEY
----

<1> Replace `${RELEASE}` with a release name like `testing` or `snapshot`.

Install _OpenNMS_ with _YUM_ following the normal installation procedure.

.Installation of the full _OpenNMS_ application with all dependencies
[source, shell]
