== Yum/APT Package Repositories

Installation packages are available for different releases of _OpenNMS_.
You need to choose which release you would like to run and then configure your package repository to point to that release.
Configuring a package repository will enable you to install and update the software by using standard Linux software update tools like _yum_ and _apt_.

The following package repositories are available:

._OpenNMS_ package repositories
