[[gi-install-opennms-windows]]
=== Microsoft Windows

IMPORTANT: This guide does not apply to OpenNMS Meridian, which can be installed only on Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS systems.

_OpenNMS_ is mostly developed on Unix/Linux based systems, nevertheless it is possible to install the platform on _Microsoft Windows_ operating systems.
To install the application a graphical installer is provided and can be used to install _OpenNMS_ on _Microsoft Windows_.
This section describes how to install the _OpenNMS_ platform on _Microsoft Windows 2012 Server_.

NOTE: The standalone installer for _Microsoft Windows_ is only available for the most recent stable version of _OpenNMS_.

IMPORTANT: It is required to have link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Oracle JDK 8] installed.
           The _JRE_ is *NOT* sufficient.

TIP: To edit _OpenNMS_ configuration files on _Microsoft Windows_ the tool link:https://notepad-plus-plus.org/[Notepad++] can deal with the formatting of _.property_ and _.xml_ files.

The setup process is described in the following steps:

. Installation of _PostgreSQL_ database service
. Download and install the graphical _OpenNMS_ installer
. First start of the _OpenNMS_ application

[[gi-install-opennms-deb-prepare-pg]]
==== Install PostgreSQL

_PostgreSQL_ is available for _Microsoft Windows_ and latest version can be downloaded from link:http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/pgdownload#windows[Download PostgreSQL] page.
Follow the on-screen instructions of the graphical installer.

NOTE: The placeholder `{PG-VERSION}` represents the _PostgreSQL_ version number.
      A version of _9.1+_ is required for _OpenNMS_.

The following information has to be provided:

* Installation directory for _PostgreSQL_, e.g. `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\{PG-VERSION}`
* Password for the database superuser (_postgres_), this password will be used during the _OpenNMS_ setup.
* Port to listen for _PostgreSQL_ connections, default is `5432` and can normally be used.
* Locale for the database, keep `[Default locale]`, if you change the locale, _OpenNMS_ may not be able to initialize the database.

TIP: It is not required to install anything additional from the _PostgreSQL Stack Builder_.

NOTE: The database data directory is automatically initialized during the setup and the _postgresql-x64-{PG-VERSION}_ is already added as service and automatically started at system boot.

NOTE: It is not necessary to change the authentication method in `pg_hba.conf`, it is by default set to `md5` for localhost connections.

==== Install OpenNMS with GUI installer

For _Microsoft Windows_ environments download the _standalone-opennms-installer-{ONMS-VERSION}.zip_ file from the link:http://sourceforge.net/projects/opennms/files/OpenNMS/[OpenNMS SourceForge] repository.
Extract the downloaded _ZIP_ file.

NOTE: The `{ONMS-VERSION}` has to be replaced with the latest stable version.

Start the graphical installer and follow the on screen instructions.
The following information has to be provided:

* Path to _Oracle JDK_, e.g. `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_51`
* Installation path for _OpenNMS_, e.g. `C:\Program Files\OpenNMS`
* Select packages which has to be installed, the minimum default selection is _Core_ and _Docs_
* PostgreSQL Database connection
** Host: Server with _PostgreSQL_ running, e.g. `localhost`
** Name: Database name for _OpenNMS_, e.g. `opennms`
** Port: _TCP_ port connecting to _PostgreSQL_ server, e.g. `5432`
** Username (administrative superuser): _PostgreSQL_ superuser, e.g. `postgres`
** Password (administrative superuser): Password given during _PostgreSQL_ setup for the superuser
** Username (runtime user for opennms): Username to connect to the _OpenNMS_ database, e.g. `opennms`
** Password (runtime user for opennms): Password to connect to the _OpenNMS_ database, e.g. `opennms`
* Configure a discovery range for an initial node discovery.
  If you don't want any discovery set begin and end to the same unreachable address.

IMPORTANT: Choose secure passwords for all database users and don't use the example passwords above in production.

WARNING: There is currently an open issue in the installer link:http://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-7831[NMS-7831].
         Username and password are not written to the `opennms-datasources.xml` file and has to be changed manually.
         The initialize of the database will fail with an authentication error.

<1> Set the user name to access the _OpenNMS_ database table
<2> Set the password to access the _OpenNMS_ database table
<3> Set the _postgres_ user for administrative access to PostgreSQL
<4> Set the password for administrative changes of the _OpenNMS_ database table

After setting the username and passwords in `opennms-datasources.xml` re-run the graphical installer and also initialize the database.
_OpenNMS_ can be started and stopped with the `start.bat` and `stop.bat` script located in `%OPENNMS_HOME%\bin` directory.

After starting _OpenNMS_ with the `start.bat` file the web application can be accessed on http://<ip-or-fqdn-of-your-server>:8980/opennms.
The default login user is _admin_ and the password is initialized to _admin_.

IMPORTANT: Change the default admin password to a secure password immediately.

TIP: The Wiki article link:http://www.opennms.org/wiki/Configuring_openNMS_as_Windows_Service[Configuring OpenNMS as Windows Service] describes how to create a _Windows Service_ from the `start.bat` files.
     There is also a link:http://yajsw.sourceforge.net/#mozTocId527639[Java Wrapper] which allows to install _Java_ applications as _Windows Service_.
