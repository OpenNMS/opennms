== OpenNMS Minion

_Minion_ gives enterprises the ability to create a globally distributed, scalable monitoring fabric.

IMPORTANT: Support for _Minion_ is currently _experimental_ and packages are only available for RHEL-based systems.

NOTE: Before attempting to setup _Minion_, you must have an instance of _OpenNMS_ set up using the same version of the packages.

_Minion_ can be installed on the same system as _OpenNMS_ or on other systems provided that it can communicate with:

. The OpenNMS REST interface
. The ActiveMQ broker used by OpenNMS
