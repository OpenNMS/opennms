=== Installing Minion

This section describes how to install the _Minion_ and how to configure it to communicate with a central _{opennms-product-name}_ instance.

Installing a distributed _{opennms-product-name}_ requires:

* Instance of _{opennms-product-name}_ needs to be same version as _Minion_ Packages
* Packages are available as _RPMs_ for _RHEL_-based systems and _DEBs_ for _Debian_-based systems (including Ubuntu)
* _{opennms-product-name}_ needs to be installed and the communication to the _ReST_ and _ActiveMQ_ endpoints is possible
