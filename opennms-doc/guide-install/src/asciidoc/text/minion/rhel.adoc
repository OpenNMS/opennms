=== Installing on RHEL-based systems

This section describes how to install _Minion_ on a _RHEL_ based system.

NOTE: This description was built on _RHEL 7_ and _CentOS 7.1_.

Start by <<gi-install-opennms-yum-repo,setting up the OpenNMS YUM repository>> and <<gi-install-oracle-java,installing Java>>.

NOTE: The Minion currently requires a JDK. See http://issues.opennms.org/browse/HZN-620[HZN-620] for details.

Once the _YUM_ repository has been configured:

.Install the Minion packages
[source, bash]
----
yum -y install opennms-minion
----

The following packages will be automatically installed:

* _opennms-minion_: The Minion meta package
* _opennms-minion-container_: The _Karaf_ OSGi container with _Minion_ branding and additional management extensions
* _opennms-minion-features-core_: Core utilities and services required by the _Minion_ features
* _opennms-minion-features-default_: Service-specific features

The _Minion_ packages setup the following directory structure:

[source, shell]
----
[root@localhost /opt/minion]# $ tree -L 1
.
├── bin
├── deploy
├── etc
├── lib
├── repositories
└── system
----

[[gi-install-minion-rhel-init]]
==== Initialize Minion

.System startup configuration for _Minion_
[source, shell]
----
systemctl enable minion
----

.Startup _Minion_
[source, shell]
----
systemctl start minion
----

After starting _Minion_ the shell can be accessed locally on ssh://localhost:8201.
The default login user is _admin_ and the password is initialized to _admin_.

[source, shell]
----
[root@localhost /root]# $ ssh -oPort=8201 admin@localhost
----
