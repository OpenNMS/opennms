== Use R for statistical computing

link:https://www.r-project.org/[R] is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.
_{opennms-product-name}_ can leverage the power of _R_ for forecasting and advanced calculations on collected time series data.

_{opennms-product-name}_ interfaces with _R_ via _stdin_ and _stdout_, and for this reason, _R_ must be installed on the same host
as _{opennms-product-name}_.
Note that installing _R_ is optional, and not required by any of the core components.

IMPORTANT: The _R_ integration is not currently supported on _Microsoft Windows_ systems.
