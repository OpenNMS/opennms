== Minion with custom messaging system

_Minions_ and _{opennms-product-name}_  communicate via a messaging system.
By default, an embedded _ActiveMQ_ broker is used.
_{opennms-product-name}_ is designed to work with different messaging systems and based on the system requirements or workload, an alternative to _ActiveMQ_ can be used.
In general, the communication between _{opennms-product-name}_ and _Minion_ is provided by two patterns:

* _Remote Producer Calls (RPCs)_ are used to issue specific tasks (such as a request to poll or perform data collection) from an _{opennms-product-name}_ instance to a _Minion_ in a remote location.
** These calls are normally self-contained and include all of the meta-data and information required for them to be performed.
* The _Sink_ pattern is used to send unsolicited messages (i.e. _Syslog_, _SNMP Traps_ or _Flows_) received from a _Minion_ to an _{opennms-product-name}_ instance

This section describes how you can setup _{opennms-product-name}_ to use other supported messaging systems for the communication with _Minions_.
