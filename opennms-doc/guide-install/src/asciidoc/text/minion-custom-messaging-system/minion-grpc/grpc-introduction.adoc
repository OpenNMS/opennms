=== Minion with gRPC Strategy

_Minions_ and _{opennms-product-name}_ can communicate via link:https://grpc.io/[gRPC] for both _RPC_ and _Sink_ patterns.
While using `GRPC` strategy Minion runs a _gRPC_ client that connects to _{opennms-product-name}_ gRPC server on a custom port.

RPC pattern on GRPC strategy uses bidirectional streaming to send requests from _{opennms-product-name}_ and get responses back from Minion.
Sink pattern on GRPC strategy uses unidirectional streaming to send sink messages from Minion to _{opennms-product-name}_.

This section describes how you can set up _{opennms-product-name}_ to use `gRPC` for communication with _Minions_.
