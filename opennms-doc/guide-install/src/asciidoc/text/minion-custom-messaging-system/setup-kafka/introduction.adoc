=== Setup using Apache Kafka

This section describes how to use _Apache Kafka_ as a messaging system between _{opennms-product-name}_ and _Minions_ in a remote location.

==== Objectives

* Configure _{opennms-product-name}_ to forward _RPC_ to a _Minion_
* Configure _Minion_ to forward messages over the _Sink_ component to an _{opennms-product-name}_ instance
* Disable the embedded _Active MQ_ message broker on the _Minion_.
* Verify the functionality on the _Minion_ using the `health:check` command and ensure the _Minion_ is registered and monitored in the _{opennms-product-name}_ web interface

==== Before you begin

The following requirements should be satisfied before you can start with this tutorial:

* At least a minimal Kafka system up and running
  If you want to start in a lab, the link:https://kafka.apache.org/20/documentation.html#quickstart[Apache Kafka Quickstart] guide is a good starting point
* An instance running with _{opennms-product-name}_ and at least one deployed _Minion_
* Communication between _{opennms-product-name}_, _Minion_ and _Apache Kafka_ is possible on TCP port 9092

.Network topology used for the following configuration example
image:minion-custom-messaging-system/setup-minion-kafka.png[]

NOTE: The example is used to describe how the components need to be configured.
      IP addresses and hostnames need to be adjusted accordingly.

NOTE: You can add more than one Kafka server to the configuration.
      The driver will attempt to connect to the first entry.
      If that is successful the whole broker topology will be discovered and will be known by the client.
      The other entries are only used if the connection to the first entry fails.
