=== Information about Minion Packages and Configuration
This section contains miscellaneous information about the Minion installation. 

==== Directory structure

A successful installation means the Minion is installed in the following directory structure:

[source, shell]
----
[root@localhost /opt/minion]# $ tree -L 1
.
├── bin
├── deploy
├── etc
├── lib
├── repositories
└── system
----

TIP: In Debian, symbolic links are set up pointing to `/etc/minion` and `/var/log/minion` to match Debian’s expected filesystem layout.

==== Startup configuration

Edit `/etc/sysconfig/minion` file (RHEL) or the `/etc/default/minion` file (Debian) to change the Minion's startup configuration, if you want to override the defaults used at start up including:

* Location of the JDK
* Memory usage
* User to run as

==== Alternate way to configure credentials

You can also configure credentials by using the `scvcli` utility in your Minion `bin` directory:

[source]
----
cd /opt/minion
./bin/scvcli set opennms.http #minion user name minion password
./bin/scvcli set opennms.broker #minion user name minion password
