Connect with _SSH_ to your remote _RHEL_ system where you need a _Minion_ to be installed.

.Install the Yum repository
[source, shell]
----
yum -y install https://yum.opennms.org/repofiles/opennms-repo-stable-rhel7.noarch.rpm
rpm --import https://yum.opennms.org/OPENNMS-GPG-KEY
----

.Install the Minion package
[source, bash]
----
yum -y install opennms-minion
----

The following packages will be automatically installed:

* _opennms-minion_: The Minion meta package
* _opennms-minion-container_: The _Karaf_ OSGi container with _Minion_ branding and additional management extensions
* _opennms-minion-features-core_: Core utilities and services required by the _Minion_ features
* _opennms-minion-features-default_: Service-specific features

With the successful installed packages the _Minion_ is installed in the following directory structure:

[source, shell]
----
[root@localhost /opt/minion]# $ tree -L 1
.
├── bin
├── deploy
├── etc
├── lib
├── repositories
└── system
----

The Minion's startup configuration can be changed by editing the `/etc/sysconfig/minion` file.
It allows to override the defaults used at startup including:

* Location of the JDK
* Memory usage
* User to run as
