==== Step 1: Setup {opennms-product-name} to allow Minion communication

Communication between a _Minion_ and _{opennms-product-name}_ uses _REST API_ and a messaging system, by default _ActiveMQ_.
An authenticated user in _{opennms-product-name}_ is required for these communication channels.
The security role _ROLE_MINION_ includes the minimal amount of permissions required for a _Minion_ to operate.

IMPORTANT: As an example we use in this guide the user name _minion_ with password _minion_.
           Change the credentials accordingly.

.Create a user minion in the {opennms-product-name} web user interface
. Login the web user interface with a user which has administrative permissions
. Go in the main navigation to _"Login Name -> Configure OpenNMS -> Configure Users, Groups and On-Call Roles -> Configure Users"_
. Add a new user with login name _minion_ and password _minion_ and click _Ok_
. Assign the security role _ROLE_MINION_, optional fill in a comment for what location and purpose the user is used for and click _Finish_
. The _minion_ user should now be listed in the _User List_

.Configure ActiveMQ to allow communication on public network interface
[source, shell]
----
vi ${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/opennms-activemq.xml
----

.Remove comments for the transport connector listening on 0.0.0.0 and save
[source, xml]
----
<transportConnector name="openwire" uri="tcp://0.0.0.0:61616?useJmx=false&amp;maximumConnections=1000&amp;wireformat.maxFrameSize=104857600"/>
----

.Restart {opennms-product-name}
[source, shell]
----
systemctl restart opennms
----

.Verify if port 61616/tcp is listening on all interfaces
[source, shell]
----
ss -lnpt sport = :61616
State   Recv-Q  Send-Q  Local Address:Port  Peer  Address:Port
LISTEN  0       128     *:61616             *:*   users:(("java",pid=1,fd=706))
