=== Installing on RHEL

Use the following commands to install the Minion package, start the Minion, test access to the Karaf shell, configure Minion to communicate with {opennms-product-name}, and verify connectivity. 

You must run all commands on the command line interface with _root_ permissions.

IMPORTANT: Make sure you have xref:gi-minion-setup-communication[set up {opennms-product-name}] to allow communication with the Minion before completing the steps in this section.

For miscellaneous installation information including Minion directory structure, startup configuration, and an alternate way to configure credentials, see <<minion-communication, Information about Minion Packages and Configuration>>.

IMPORTANT: Commands and instructions are specific to RHEL 8. 
We provide RHEL 7 alternatives where applicable.
