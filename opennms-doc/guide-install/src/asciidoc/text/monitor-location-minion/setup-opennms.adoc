==== Set Up {opennms-product-name} to allow Minion communication

Communication between a Minion and {opennms-product-name} uses the REST API and a messaging system, by default ActiveMQ.
Before installing a Minion, you need to create an authenticated user with the _ROLE_MINION_ security role for these communication channels.

IMPORTANT: This guide uses the user name _minion_ with password _minion_ as an example.
           Change your credentials accordingly.

.Create a minion user in the {opennms-product-name} web UI:
. Log in to the web UI as an administrative user. 
. Click on the gears icon and choose *Configure Users, Groups and On-Call Roles -> Configure Users*.
. Add a new user with login name _minion_ and password _minion_ and click *OK*.
. In the *Security Roles* area, assign the _ROLE_MINION_ security role.
.. Optional: fill in a comment for the Minion user's location and purpose.
. Click *Finish*.

The _minion_ user should now be listed in the user List.

.Configure ActiveMQ to allow communication on public network interface:
[source, shell]
----
vi ${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/opennms-activemq.xml
----

.Remove comments for the transport connector listening on 0.0.0.0 and save
[source, xml]
----
<transportConnector name="openwire" uri="tcp://0.0.0.0:61616?useJmx=false&amp;maximumConnections=1000&amp;wireformat.maxFrameSize=104857600"/>
----

.Restart {opennms-product-name}
[source, shell]
----
systemctl restart opennms
----

.Verify that port 61616/tcp is listening on all interfaces
[source, shell]
----
ss -lnpt sport = :61616
State   Recv-Q  Send-Q  Local Address:Port  Peer  Address:Port
LISTEN  0       128     *:61616             *:*   users:(("java",pid=1,fd=706))
