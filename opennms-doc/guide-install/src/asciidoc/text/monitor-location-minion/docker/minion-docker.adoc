=== Run with Docker

Modern infrastructure allows you to deploy and run workloads in containers.
_{opennms-product-name}_ provides and publishes container images on link:https://hub.docker.com/u/opennms[DockerHub].

==== Objectives

* Run and configure a _Minion_ in, and connect it to, the _{opennms-product-name}_ instance using environment variables
* Introduce a reference with all available configuration and mount conventions for more advanced setups

==== Before you begin

You must have at least the following components installed:

* Current stable _Docker_ release installed, e.g., installed from link:https://docs.docker.com/[Docker Documentation]
* Current stable _Docker Compose_ installed, e.g., installed from link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Docker Compose instructions]
You should have a basic knowledge of _Docker_, _Docker Compose_ with networking, persisting files and mounting directories
_{opennms-product-name}_ is configured to accept connections via _ActiveMQ_ and a Minion user with _ROLE_MINION_ 
The _Minion_ can connect to _{opennms-product-name}_ with port `61616/TCP` for _ActiveMQ_ and _REST_ on port `8980/TCP`

==== Quickstart service stack

// No section numbers for step-by-step guide
:!sectnums:

===== Step 1: Create service stack with a Minion

Create a project directory with `mkdir opennms-minion` and create a `docker-compose.yml` file in that directory with the following content:

[source,yaml]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
---
version: '3'

services:  
  minion:
    image: opennms/minion:{opennms-version}
    container_name: minion<1>
    network_mode: host<2>
    environment:
      - TZ=Europe/Berlin<3>
      - MINION_ID=my-minion<4>
      - MINION_LOCATION=my-location<5>
      - OPENNMS_BROKER_URL=failover:tcp://horizon-instance:61616<6>
      - OPENNMS_BROKER_USER=minion-user<7>
      - OPENNMS_BROKER_PASS=minion-password
      - OPENNMS_HTTP_URL=http://horizon-instance:8980/opennms<8>
      - OPENNMS_HTTP_USER=minion-user<9>
      - OPENNMS_HTTP_PASS=minion-password
    command: ["-f"]
----
<1> Friendly container name
<2> If you process UDP data like SNMP traps, Syslogs or flows, `network_mode: host` ensures the UDP source addresses are not modified
<3> Time zone for the _Minion_
<4> A defined identifier for this _Minion_. If not set, a unique user identifier (_UUID_) will be generated
<5> The name of the location of the _Minion_ and the connection to the _ActiveMQ_ broker running in _{opennms-product-name}_
<6> _ActiveMQ_ broker endpoint from _{opennms-product-name}_
<7> Authentication for ActiveMQ broker
<8> _REST_ endpoint to connect to the _{opennms-product-name}_ instance
<9> Authentication for the _REST_ endpoint

NOTE: In this example we haven't set credentials to connect the _Minion_ via _REST_ and the _ActiveMQ Message Broker_.
      The _Minion_ will fall back and uses the default admin/admin credentials for communication.
      Permissions for _ActiveMQ_ and _REST_ are assigned with the role _ROLE_MINION_ on the _{opennms-product-name}_ instance.

WARNING: If you process UDP data and you don't use `network_mode: host`, the UDP source address from your packets will be modified from Docker.
         The source address is your Docker internal gateway instead of the source address of your device.
         Source addresses associate the Syslog or SNMP traps to the nodes in the OpenNMS database.
         You can use an isolated network and publish ports as usual if you don't receive UDP-based monitoring data.
         If you don't use `network_mode: host` you have to publish the listener ports manually.

===== Step 2: Start the service stack and test the functionality

[source,shell]
----
cd opennms-minion
docker-compose up -d
----

===== Step 3: Run _Minion_ Health Check

.Log in to the _Minion Karaf Shell_ and run the health check
[source, shell]
----
ssh admin@localhost -p 8201

admin@minion> health:check
Verifying the health of the container

Connecting to OpenNMS ReST API   [ Success  ]
Verifying installed bundles      [ Success  ]
Connecting to JMS Broker         [ Success  ]

=> Everything is awesome
----

NOTE: The default admin password for the _Minion Karaf Shell_ is _admin_.

===== Step 4: Verify status in the web UI

* Log in as admin in the _{opennms-product-name}_ web interface
* _Configure OpenNMS -> Manage Minions_. The _Minion_ should be registered and the status should be _up_
* Verify that _Minion_ is provisioned automatically by going to _Info -> Nodes_ and selecting the _Minion_. The services _JMX-Minion_, _Minion-Heartbeat_ and _Minion-RPC_ should be _up_ and provisioned on the local loop-back interface
