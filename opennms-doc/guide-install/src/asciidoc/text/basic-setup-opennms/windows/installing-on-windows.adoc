=== Installing on Windows

The installer for _Microsoft Windows_ does not handle _PostgreSQL_ and _Java_ dependencies as on _Linux_ operating systems.

IMPORTANT: Ensure you have installed _Oracle Java Development Kit 8 (JDK)_ which is available on the link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Oracle] page.

The following steps will be described:

. Install _PostgreSQL_ on _Microsoft Windows_
. Install _{opennms-product-name}_ with GUI installer
. Initialize _PostgreSQL_ database and configure access
. Log in to the Web User Interface and change default admin password

It is required to have local administration permission to install _{opennms-product-name}_.

TIP: To edit _OpenNMS_ configuration files on _Microsoft Windows_ the tool link:https://notepad-plus-plus.org/[Notepad++] can deal with the formatting of _.property_ and _.xml_ files.
