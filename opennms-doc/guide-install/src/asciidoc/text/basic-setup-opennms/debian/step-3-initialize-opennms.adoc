TIP: If you want to receive SNMP Traps or Syslog messages you have to allow incoming traffic on your host firewall as well.
     By default OpenNMS SNMP trap daemon is listening on 162/udp and Syslog daemon is listening on 10514/udp.
     The SNMP Trap daemon is enabled by default, the OpenNMS Syslog daemon is disabled.
