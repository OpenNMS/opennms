== Sentinel

This section describes how to install the _Sentinel_ to scale individual components of {opennms-product-name}.

NOTE:   At the moment only flows can be distributed using _Sentinel_.
        In the future more components will follow.

=== Before you begin

Setting up a _{opennms-product-name}_ with _Sentinel_ requires:

* Instance of _{opennms-product-name}_ needs to be exact same version as _Sentinel_ packages
* Packages are available as _RPMs_ for _RHEL_-based systems and _DEBs_ for _Debian_-based systems
* _{opennms-product-name}_ needs to be installed and communication to the _REST (8980/tcp)_ and _ActiveMQ (616161/tcp)_ endpoints is possible
* At least one _Minion_ needs to be installed and successful communicate with the _{opennms-product-name}_

Depending on the installed operating system, the path for _Sentinel_ is different.
If the instruction refers to `${SENTINEL_HOME}`, the path is resolved to the following directories:
