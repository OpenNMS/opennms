==== Step 1: Setup {opennms-product-name} to allow Sentinel communication

This step is exactly the same as for _Minion_.
Even the role name `ROLE_MINION` can be used, as there does not exist a dedicated role `ROLE_SENTINEL` yet.

Therefore, please refer to section <<gi-minion-rhel-setup-communication, Setup {opennms-product-name} to allow Minion communication>>.

NOTE:   Even if we have to configure the communication to the _{opennms-product-name}_ exactly the same as for _Minion_
        no ReST requests are made and may be removed at a later state.
