== Setup Minion with a config file

Beside manually configuring a _Minion_ instance via the _Karaf CLI_ it is possibleto modify and deploy its configuration file through configuration management tools.
The configuration file is located in `${MINION_HOME}/etc/org.opennms.minion.controller.cfg`.
All configurations set in _Karaf CLI_ will be persisted in this configuration file which can also be populated through configuration management tools.

.Configuration file for Minion
[source]
----
id = 00000000-0000-0000-0000-deadbeef0001
location = MINION
broker-url = tcp://myopennms.example.org:61616
http-url = http://myopennms.example.org:8980/opennms
----

The _Minion_ needs to be restarted when this configuration file is changed.

TIP: In case the credentials needs to be set through the _CLI_ with configuration management tools or scripts, the `${MINION_HOME}/bin/client` command can be used which allows to execute _Karaf_ commands through the Linux shell.
