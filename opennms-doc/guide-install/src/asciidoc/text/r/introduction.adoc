[[gi-install-r]]
== R Statistics System

link:https://www.r-project.org/[R] is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.
_OpenNMS_ can leverage the power of _R_ for forecasting and advanced calculations on collected time series data.

_OpenNMS_ interfaces with _R_ via _stdin_ and _stdout_, and for this reason, _R_ must be installed on the same host
as _OpenNMS_.
Note that installing _R_ is optional, and not required by any of the core components.

IMPORTANT: The _R_ integration is not currently supported on _Microsoft Windows_ systems.
