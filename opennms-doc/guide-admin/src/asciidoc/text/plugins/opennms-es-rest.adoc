=== Elasticsearch ReST plugin

The _Elasticsearch ReST plugin_ provides an interface to forward events, alarms and alarm change events generated by
 the _Alarm Change Notifier Plugin_ to _Elasticsearch_ (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch). The events and alarms in _Elasticsearch_
can be used for indexing, long time archival, plotting with _Grafana_ and browsing with _Kibana_.
 
This plugin uses the _Elasticsearch_ ReST interface and can interact with cloud-hosted Elasticsearch instances. 
The interface has been tested with _Elasticsearch_ 2.4, 5.0, and 5.1. 

NOTE: If you use _Kibana_, make sure you are using the version that is compatible with your version of _Elasticsearch_.

The _Elasticsearch ReST plugin_ uses the Jest library (https://github.com/searchbox-io/Jest) to access the _Elasticsearch_ ReST interface.

==== Configuration

Configuration is held in:
----
/etc/org.opennms.plugin.elasticsearch.rest.forwarder.cfg
----
With the following properties (defaults shown will be used if file is not present)

[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Parameter                 | Default Value         | Required | Description
|`elasticsearchUrl`         | http://localhost:9200 | optional | URL of _Elasticsearch_ ReST interface. This value can also contain a comma-separated list of URLs that will be used in round-robin fashion for increased scalability.
|`esusername`               |                       | optional | Username to access _Elasticsearch_.
|`espassword`               |                       | optional | Password to access _Elasticsearch_.
|`logEventDescription`      | true                  | optional | Whether to forward the event description field to _Elasticsearch_. It can be disabled because it contains a long text field that can be redundant with the rest of the metadata included in the event.
|`archiveRawEvents`         | true                  | optional | Archive events.
|`archiveAlarms`            | true                  | optional | Archive alarms.
|`archiveAlarmChangeEvents` | true                  | optional | Archive alarm change events.
|`archiveOldAlarmValues`    | true                  | optional | For alarm change events, we can choose to archive the detailed alarm values but this is expensive. Set false in production.
|`archiveNewAlarmValues`    | true                  | optional | 
|`archiveAssetData`         | true                  | optional | If true The following attributes representing useful node asset fields from the node asset table are included in archived events and alarms. These are included only where the values are not null or empty strings in the table. 

(asset-latitude,asset-longitude,asset-region,asset-building,asset-floor,asset-room,asset-rack,asset-slot,asset-port,asset-category,asset-displaycategory,asset-notifycategory,asset-pollercategory,asset-thresholdcategory,asset-managedobjecttype,asset-managedobjectinstance,asset-manufacturer,asset-vendor,asset-modelnumber,parent-nodelabel,parent-nodeid,parent-foreignsource,parent-foreignid)
|`groupOidParameters`       | false                 | optional | If `true` all oid from the event parameters are stored in a single array `p_oids` instead of a flattened structue.
|`logAllEvents`             | false                 | optional | If changed to true, then archive all events even if they have not been persisted in the _{opennms-product-name}_ database.
|`retries`                  | 0                     | optional | The number of times to retry an _Elasticsearch_ operation that fails completely. You can increase `retries` to avoid losing forwarded events and alarms when _Elasticsearch_ is down or unreachable.
|`timeout`                  | 5000                  | optional | The interval between subsequent retries when a `retries` value greater than 1 is being used.
|`batchSize`                | 1                     | optional | Increase this value to enable batch inserts into _Elasticsearch_. This is the maximum size of a batch of events that is sent to _Elasticsearch_ in a single connection.
|`batchInterval`            | 0                     | optional | The maximum time interval in milliseconds between batch events (recommended: 500ms) when a `batchSize` value greater than 1 is being used.
|===

Once you are sure everything is correctly configured, you can activate the _Elasticsearch_ forwarder by logging into the _OSGi_ console and installing the feature.

._OSGi_ login and installation of the _Elasticsearch_ forwarder
[source, shell]
----
ssh admin@localhost -p 8101
feature:install opennms-es-rest
----

==== Loading Historical Events

It is possible to load historical _{opennms-product-name}_ events into _Elasticsearch_ from the _{opennms-product-name}_ database using a _karaf_ console command.
The command uses the _{opennms-product-name}_ Events ReST interface to retrieve a set number of historical events and forward them to 
_Elasticsearch_. Because we are using the ReST interface it is also possible to contact a remote _{opennms-product-name}_ and download 
its events into _Elasticsearch_ by using the correct remote URL and credentials.

----
open karaf command prompt using
ssh -p 8101 admin@localhost
----
To send historic events to _Elasticsearch_ use a command of the form:
----
karaf> elastic-search:send-historic-events limit offset [ onms-username onms-password onms-url use-node-label ]
----
The _mandatory_ parameters are

- limit  - Limit of number of events to send 
- offset - Offset for starting list of events

(note that the limit parameter works in multiples of 10 and may send more than the limit to round to 10 events)

The following parameters are _optional_ and will use defaults if not set

- onms-username -  ReST password for opennms (default: admin)
- onms-password - ReST username for opennms (default: admin)
- onms-url - URL of _{opennms-product-name}_ ReST interface to retrieve events to send  (default: http://localhost:8980)
- use-node-label - If false local node cache will get nodelabel for nodeid. If true will use remote nodelabel (default: false)

If you are uploading events from the local machine on which you are running this command, you should use
the local node cache as this supplies a number of node values including the nodelabel. 
If you are uploading from a remote machine you should use the remote node label and not the local node cache. Only the remote
nodelabel is provided in this case.

Command examples:
----
# This retrieves 110 alarms from the local machine using the 
# local node cache for node label
elastic-search:send-historic-events 100 0 admin admin http://localhost:8980 false

# This retrieves 110 alarms from the remote machine using the remote node labels
elastic-search:send-historic-events 100 0 demo demo http://demo.opennms.org true
----

==== Index Definitions

Three indices are created; one for alarms, one for alarm change events and one for raw events. 
Alarms and alarm change events are only saved if the alarm-change-notifier plugin is also 
installed to generate alarm change events from the _{opennms-product-name}_ alarms table. 
The index names are of the form:
----
<name>-<date>/type/id
----

For example

a) Alarms
----
opennms-alarms-2017.01/alarmdata/1823
----

b) Alarm Change Events
----
opennms-events-alarmchange-2017.01/eventdata/11549
----

c) Raw _{opennms-product-name}_ events (not including alarm change events)
----
opennms-events-raw-2017.01/eventdata/11549
----

==== Viewing events using Kibana Sense 

_Kibana Sense_ is a _Kibana_ app which allows you to run queries directly against _Elasticsearch_.
(https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/sense/current/installing.html)

If you install _Kibana Sense_ you can use the following commands to view the alarms and events sent to _Elasticsearch_
You should review the _Elasticsearch_ ReST API documentation to understand how searches are specified. 
(See https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search.html)
