==== Transparent Bridge Discovery

Discovering _Layer 2_ network links using the _Bridge Forwarding_ table requires a special algorithm.
To discover _Links_ an algorithm based on a scientific paper with the title link:http://cs-pub.bu.edu/groups/nrg/readinglist/lowekamp-sigcomm01.pdf[Topology Discovery for Large Ethernet Networks] is implemented.
The gathered information is used to classify _Links_ in _macLink_ and _bridgeLink_.
A _macLink_ represents a _Link_ between a workstation or server identified by a mac address.
A _bridgeLink_ is a _connection_ between backbone ports.

Transparent bridging is not loop free so if you have loops you have to enable the spanning tree protocol that will detect loops and again will put some ports in a _blocking_ state to avoid loops.
To get links it is necessary to perform some calculations that let us define the _Links_.
The following _MIBS_ must be supported by the _SNMP agent_ to allow _Transparent Bridge Discovery_.

| _vtpVersion_                    | `.1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.46.1.1.1.0` | The version of VTP in use on the local system.

                                                                    If the device does not support _VTP_, the version is _none(3)_.

| _ipNetToMediaPhysAddress_       | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.2`       | The media-dependent _physical_ address.

| _ipNetToMediaType_              | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.4`       | The type of mapping. Setting this object to the value _invalid(2)_ has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the _ipNetToMediaTable_.
                                                                    That is, it effectively dissasociates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry.
                                                                    It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table.
                                                                    Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use.
                                                                    Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant _ipNetToMediaType_ object.
