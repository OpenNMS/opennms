==== CDP Discovery

The _Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP)_ is a proprietary link layer protocol from _Cisco_.
It is used by network devices to advertise identity, capabilities and neighbors.
_CDP_ performs functions similar to several proprietary protocols, such as the _Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP)_, _Extreme Discovery Protocol_, _Foundry Discovery Protocol (FDP)_, _Nortel Discovery Protocol (also known as SONMP)_, and _Microsoft's Link Layer Topology Discovery (LLTD)_.
The _CDP_ discovery uses information provided by the link:http://tools.cisco.com/Support/SNMP/do/BrowseMIB.do?local=en&step=2&mibName=CISCO-CDP-MIB[CISCO-CDP-MIB] and link:http://tools.cisco.com/Support/SNMP/do/BrowseMIB.do?local=en&step=2&mibName=CISCO-VTP-MIB[CISCO-VTP-MIB].

NOTE: Only nodes with a running _CDP_ process can be part of the link discovery.
      The data is similar to running a `show cdp neighbor` command on the IOS CLI of the device.
      Linux and Windows servers don't have a _CDP_ process running by default and will not be part of the link discovery.

The following OIDs are supported to discover and build the _CDP_ network topology.
