==== IS-IS Discovery

_IS-IS Links_ are found in the _isisISAdjTable_ that is defined in _ISIS-MIB_ (mib-rfc4444.txt).
In this table is found the information needed to find the Adjacency Intermediate System.
The information about IS-IS is stored into two tables: _isisElement_ and _isisLink_.
_isisElement_ contains the _ISISSysID_, a unique identifier of the "Intermediate System" (the name for the Router in ISO protocols).
Each entry in this SNMP MIB table represents a unidirectional link from the _Intermediate System_ that is queried to the _Adjacent Intermediate Systems_ running IS-IS and "peering" with the source router.
If two routers _IS-A_ and _IS-B_ support _ISIS-MIB_, then _EnLinkd_ will create two link entries in {opennms-product-name}: one from _IS-A_ to _IS-B_ (from the _adjtable_ of _IS-A_) the complementary link back from _IS-B_ to _IS-A_ (from the _adjTable of _IS-B_).
IS-IS links are represented in the _ISIS-MIB_ as follows:

|===
| Name                         | OID                          | Description
| _isisSysID_                  | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.138.1.1.1.3.0` | The ID for this Intermediate System.
                                                                This value is appended to each of the area addresses to form the Network Entity Titles.
                                                                The derivation of a value for this object is implementation specific.
                                                                Some implementations may automatically assign values and not permit an SNMP write, while others may require the value to be set manually.
                                                                Configured values *must* survive an agent reboot.
| _isisSysAdminState_          | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.138.1.1.1.8.0` | The administrative state of this Intermediate System.
                                                                Setting this object to the value `on` when its current value is `off` enables the Intermediate System.
                                                                Configured values *must* survive an agent reboot.
| _isisSysObject_              | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.138.1.1.1`     | isisSysObject
| _isisCircIfIndex_            | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.138.1.3.2.1.2` | The value of ifIndex for the interface to which this circuit corresponds.
                                                                This object cannot be modified after creation.
| _isisCircAdminState_         | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.138.1.3.2.1.3` | The administrative state of the circuit.
| _isisISAdjState_             | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.138.1.6.1.1.2` | The state of the adjacency.
| _isisISAdjNeighSNPAAddress_  | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.138.1.6.1.1.4` | The _SNPA address_ of the neighboring system.
| _isisISAdjNeighSysType_      | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.138.1.6.1.1.5` | The type of the neighboring system.
| _isisISAdjNeighSysID_        | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.138.1.6.1.1.6` | The system ID of the neighboring Intermediate System.
| _isisISAdjNbrExtendedCircID_ | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.138.1.6.1.1.7` | The 4-byte _Extended Circuit ID_ learned from the Neighbor during 3-way handshake, or _0_.

Generic information about the _IS-IS_ link discovery process can be found in the _IS-IS Information_ box on the _Node Detail Page_ of the device.
Information gathered from this OIDs will be stored in the following database table:
