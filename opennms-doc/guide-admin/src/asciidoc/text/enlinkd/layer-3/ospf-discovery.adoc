==== OSPF Discovery

The relevant MIBs for OSPF topology are _OSPF-MIB_ and _OSPF-TRAP-MIB_.
In these MIBs are defined the relevant objects used to find OSPF links, specifically:

* The _Router ID_ which, in OSPF, has the same format as an IP address
* But identifies the router independent of its IP address.

Also all the interfaces are identified by their IP addresses.
The OSPF links come from the SNMP _ospfNbrTable_ defined in OSPF-MIB and this table is in practice persisted in the _ospfLink_ table:

.Supported OIDs from OSPF-MIB
[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Name                      | OID                      | Description
| _ospfRouterId_            | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.14.1.1.0`  | A 32-bit integer uniquely identifying the router in the Autonomous System.
                                                         By convention, to ensure uniqueness, this should default to the value of one of the router's IP interface addresses.
                                                         This object is persistent and when written the entity *should* save the change to non-volatile storage.
| _ospfAdminStat_           | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.14.1.2.0`  | The administrative status of _OSPF_ in the router.
                                                         The value _enabled_ denotes that the _OSPF Process_ is active on at least one interface; _disabled_ disables it on all interfaces.
                                                         This object is persistent and when written the entity *should* save the change to non-volatile storage.
| _ospfVersionNumber_       | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.14.1.3.0`  | The current version number of the _OSPF protocol_ is _2_.
| _ospfAreaBdrRtrStatus_    | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.14.1.4.0`  | A flag to note whether this router is an _Area Border Router_.
| _ospfAreaASBdrRtrStatus_  | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.14.1.5.0`  | A flag to note whether this router is configured as an _Autonomous System Border Router_.
                                                         This object is persistent and when written the entity *should* save the change to non-volatile storage.
| _ospfIfIpAddress_         | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.14.7.1.1`  | The IP address of this _OSPF_ interface.
| _ospfAddressLessIf_       | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.14.7.1.2`  | For the purpose of easing the instancing of addressed and addressless interfaces; this variable takes the value _0_ on interfaces with IP addresses and the corresponding value of _ifIndex_ for interfaces having no _IP address_.
| _ospfNbrIpAddr_           | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.14.10.1.1` | The IP address this neighbor is using in its IP source address.
                                                         Note that, on addressless links, this will not be 0.0.0.0 but the address of another of the neighbor's interfaces.
| _ospfNbrAddressLessIndex_ | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.14.10.1.2` | On an interface having an _IP address_, zero.
                                                         On addressless interfaces, the corresponding value of _ifIndex_ in the _Internet Standard MIB_.
                                                         On row creation, this can be derived from the instance.
| _ospfNbrRtrId_            | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.14.10.1.3` | A 32-bit integer (represented as a type _IpAddress_) uniquely identifying the neighboring router in the _Autonomous System_.

.Supported OIDs from IP-MIB
[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Name                     | OID                     | Description
| _ipAdEntIfIndex_         | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.20.1.2` | The index value which uniquely identifies the interface to which this entry is applicable.
                                                       The interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of the _IF-MIB's ifIndex_.
| _ipAdEntNetMask_         | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.20.1.3` | The subnet mask associated with the _IPv4_ address of this entry.
                                                       The value of the mask is an _IPv4_ address with all the network bits set to _1_ and all the hosts bits set to _0_.

Generic information about the _OSPF_ link discovery process can be found in the _OSPF Information_ box on the _Node Detail Page_ of the device.
Information gathered from these OIDs will be stored in the following database table:
