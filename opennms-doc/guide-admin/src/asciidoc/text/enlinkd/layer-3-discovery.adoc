=== Layer 3 Link Discovery

With _Enlinkd_ it is possible to get _Links_ based on network routing applications.
The following routing daemons can be used to provide a discovery of links based _Layer 3_ information:

* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Shortest_Path_First[Open Shortest Path First] (OSPF)
* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IS-IS[Intermediate System to Intermediate System] (IS-IS)

This information is provided by _SNMP Agents_ with appropriate _MIB support_.
For this reason it is required to have a working _SNMP_ configuration running.
The link data discovered from _Enlinkd_ is provided in the _Topology User Interface_ and on the detail page of a node.
