The goal of _Sentinel_ is to scale out and distribute individual components from _{opennms-product-name}_.

WARNING:    The sentinel feature is still in development and this is only a very rough documentation, not covering all aspects.
            Please refer to the Limitations section for more details

=== Limitations

Currently _Sentinel_ is in a very early state of development and therefore the usage is limited:

 * Can only be used to process flows
 * Requires a _Minion_ to work as a producer
 * As only flows are supported, the procession of flows in {opennms-product-name} should be disabled, whereas _Telemetryd_ must not.
   This means, _Telemetryd_ can be enabled, but all listeners and adapters related to flow procession should be disabled.

=== Installation

If _Minion_ is working, the ground work for _Sentinel_ is already done.
For more details on how to install _Sentinel_ refer to the Installation Guide.

=== Clean Start
On each start the cache of the _Sentinel_ is cleared, that means the container returns in it's original state.
To disable this functionality set `karaf.clean.cache = false` in `${SENTINEL_HOME}/etc/system.properties`.

=== Configuration

It is assumed, that the _Sentinel_ container is running on a different system than the _{opennms-product-name}_ and _Minion_.
Therefore at least the following configurations are necessary:

 - Configure the datasource to connect to the Postgres database
 - Configure the controller (identity and connection to communicate with OpenNMS - same as for _Minion_)
 - Configure the communication layer (for now either JMS or Kafka)
 - Install features

==== Configure the datasource

----
config:edit org.opennms.netmgt.distributed.datasource
config:property-set datasource.url jdbc:postgresql://<db-host>:<db-port>/<db-name>
config:property-set datasource.username <db-user>
config:property-set datasource.password <db-password>
config:property-set datasource.databaseName <db-name>
config:update
----

==== Configure the controller

----
config:edit org.opennms.sentinel.controller
config:property-set location SENTINEL <1>
config:property-set id 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000ddba11 <2>
config:property-set http-url http://127.0.0.1:8980/opennms <3>
config:property-set broker-url failover:tcp://127.0.0.1:61616 <4>
config:update
----
<1> Not used at the moment, but must be provided
<2> Not used at the moment, may be omitted
<3> url which points to {opennms-product-name} (required)
<4> url which points to the {opennms-product-name} Active MQ Broker (only required if using feature `sentinel-jms`, otherwise may be omitted)

NOTE:   Basically the same properties as for the _Minion Controller_ are supported, but must be placed in config file
        `org.opennms.sentinel.controller.cfg` instead of `org.opennms.minion.controller.cfg`.

==== Configure Connectivity

By default the _Sentinel_ consumes messages from the _{opennms-product-name} ActiveMQ Broker_.
See `Configure the Controller` for more details.

As with _Minion_ the _Sentinel_ can also be configured to consume messages from _Kafka_

===== Using Kafka

When Using _Sentinel_ with _Kafka_ the same rules for using _Kafka with Minions_ apply.

====== Kafka Configuration

Each _Minion_ works as a Producer and must be configured beforehead.
Please refer to section <<ga-minion-kafka-producer-configuration, Minion Kafka Producer Configuration>> on how to configure _Minion_ as a _Kafka Producer_.

Each _Sentinel_ works as a Consumer and can be configured in the file `${SENTINEL_HOME}/etc/org.opennms.core.ipc.sink.kafka.consumer.cfg`.
Either manually or via the `config:edit org.opennms.core.ipc.sink.kafka.consumer` statement.
For supported properties, see link:https://kafka.apache.org/10/documentation.html#newconsumerconfigs[here]

By default each _Kafka Consumer_ starts consuming messages immediately after the feature has been started.
It is possible to set a property `org.opennms.core.ipc.sink.initialSleepTime` to define an initial sleep time in ms before any messages are consumed.
In order to set this up, please add an entry to the end of the file `${SENTINEL_HOME}/etc/system.properties`:

[source]
----
# Initial delay of 5 seconds before consuming of messages is started in milliseconds
org.opennms.core.ipc.sink.initialSleepTime=5000
----

==== Available features

The following list contains some features which may be installed manually:

[options="header"]
|====
| Feature                      | Required                                         | Description

| sentinel-core
| true
| Base feature, installing all required bundles such as `health:check` and service requirements for other bundles, e.g. `sentinel-persistence`.

| sentinel-jms
| false
| Provides connectivity to the {opennms-product-name} _ActiveMQ_ Broker.

| sentinel-kafka
| false
| Provides connectivity to _Kafka_.

| sentinel-flows
| false
| Feature which starts all dependencies to start processing flows.

|====


==== Auto install

In some cases it is desired to automatically configure the _Sentinel_ instance and also start required features/bundles.
As _Sentinel_ is based on _Apache Karaf_ - which supports auto deployment by simply copying any kind of data
to the `deploy` folder, _Sentinel_ can make use of that mechanism to enable auto or hot deployment.

In order to do so, in most cases it is sufficient to copy a `features.xml` file to `${SENTINEL_HOME}/deploy`.
This can be done even if the container is running.

The chapter _Configure Flow Procession_ contains an example on how to automatically start them with _Sentinel_


==== Auto Start

In some cases it might not be sufficient to auto-deploy/configure the container with a `features.xml` file.
If more flexibility is required it is suggested to modify/copy `*.cfg` and `*.properties` files directly to the `${SENTINEL_HOME}/etc` directory.
To automatically start features with the container, the file `${SENTINEL_HOME}/etc/org.apache.karaf.features.cfg` must be updated:

[source]

<1> Install and Start JMS communication feature
<2> Install and Start Sentinel Flows feature

==== Health Check / Troubleshooting

The `health:check` command allows to verify the health of the _Sentinel_ container.
It performs various health checks depending on the installed features to calculate the overall container health.
For more information please try `health:check --help`.

NOTE: In order to run the `health:check` command, the feature `sentinel-core` must be installed.

NOTE: This is also available in _Minion_ Containers and will replace the now deprecated command `minion:ping`.


=== Flow Procession

In order to process flows via _Sentinel_ ensure that _{opennms-product-name}_, _Minion_ and _Sentinel_ are all installed according
to the official Installation Guide.

Afterwards the following configuration examples help setting everything up.

==== Configure Sentinel

In order to process flows, sentinel must start appropriate flow adapters.
In _Sentinel_ flow adapters are configured by either be placing a `.cfg` file in `${SENTINEL_HOME}/etc` or via `config:edit` statement.

The following example will configure the consumption of `Netflow5` flows and saves the configuration in
`${SENTINEL_HOME/etc/org.oennms.features.telemetry.adaters-netflow5.cfg`.

First login to the _Karaf Shell_
----
$ ssh -p 8301 admin@localhost
----

----
admin@sentinel> config:edit org.opennms.features.telemetry.adapters-netflow5
admin@sentinel> config:property-set name Netflow-5
admin@sentinel> config:property-set class-name org.opennms.netmgt.telemetry.adapters.netflow.v5.Netflow5Adapter
admin@sentinel> config:update
----

Afterwards the feature `sentinel-flows` can be installed:

----
admin@sentinel> feature:install sentinel-jms <1>
admin@sentinel> feature:install sentinel-flows
----
<1> or `sentinel-kafka`

NOTE:   Only procession of `Netflow5` flows has been tested.

To check everything is working as expected, run the `health:check` command, e.g.:

----
admin@sentinel> health:check
Verifying the health of the container

Verifying installed bundles                    [ Success  ]
Connecting to JMS Broker                       [ Success  ]
Connecting to OpenNMS ReST API                 [ Success  ]
Retrieving NodeDao                             [ Success  ]
Connecting to ElasticSearch ReST API (Flows)   [ Success  ]

=> Everything is awesome
----

==== Configure Minion

The _Minion_ must be configured to listen to incoming flow packages, e.g.:

----
$ ssh -p 8201 admin@localhost
----

----
admin@minion()> config:edit org.opennms.features.telemetry.listeners-udp-8877
admin@minion()> config:property-set name Netflow-5
admin@minion()> config:property-set class-name org.opennms.netmgt.telemetry.listeners.udp.UdpListener
admin@minion()> config:property-set listener.port 8877
admin@minion()> config:update
----

NOTE:   The name of the listener, in this case `Netflow-5` must match with the name of the adapter
        configuration in the _Sentinel_ container.

==== Configure OpenNMS
_{opennms-product-name}_ must expose its _ActiveMQ Broker_ to have a _Minion_ and _Sentinel_ connect to it.
This can be done in `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/opennms-activemq.xml`.
For more details please refer to the Minion Installation Guide.


==== Auto configure flow procession for Sentinel

The following examples illustrate a `features.xml` which configures the _Sentinel_ instance and automatically starts
all required features to either consume messages via JMS (_ActiveMQ_) or _Kafka_.

Simply copy it to `${SENTINEL_HOME}/deploy/`.
