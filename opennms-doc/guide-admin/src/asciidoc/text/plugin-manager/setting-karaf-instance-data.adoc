=== Plugin Manager UI panel

The _Plugin Manager_ is accessed as an entry in the _Additional Tools_ panel of the _{opennms-product-name} Admin Gui_.

image::plugin-manager/01_adminPageEntry.png[]

The _Plugin Manager_ administration page is split into six main areas as illustrated below.

1. Top Left is the _Karaf_ Instance data panel which lists the _Karaf_ instances known to the _Plugin Manager_.
   When a _Karaf_ instance is selected, the data on the rest of the page refers to the selected instance.
2. Bottom Left is the _Available Plugins Server Panel_ which is used to set the address and passwords to access the _Available Plugins Server_ and / or the list of locally available plugins provided by a _Kar_ or _RPM_.
3. Top Right, just below the main _{opennms-product-name}_ menu bar are links to three diagnostic pages which can help test the _ReST_ interface to remote _Karaf_ Instances.
4. Middle Right is a messages panel which reports the status of any operations.
   If an operation fails, the full error message can be viewed by pressing the error message button.
5. Bottom Right is a tabbed panel which reflects the status of the plugins and licences installed in the _Karaf_ instance selected by the _Karaf_ Instance data panel.

=== Setting Karaf Instance Data

The _Karaf_ instances known to the _Plugin Manager_ are listed in the _Karaf_ Instance data panel.
`Localhost` refers to the local _{opennms-product-name}_ server and is always an option in the panel.
The _Karaf_ instance data is persisted locally and should be refreshed from remote sources using the reload _Karaf_ instance data button before changes are made.

NOTE: Please note that the `Localhost` configuration in the _Plugin Manager_  by default uses `admin` for both the username and the password. This will not work in a production OpenNMS where you have changed the admin user password. You should edit the `Localhost` configuration using the `edit instance list` button to match your local configuration)

Each _Karaf_ instance must have a unique system id which is used to update its configuration and also to validate its licences.
The system id  it must be unique and included a checksum. A new random system id can be generated for a _Karaf_ instance using a button on the panel.

In most situations the remote _Karaf_ instance can be accessed from the _{opennms-product-name}_ _Plugin Manager_.
However in many cases, the remote _Karaf_ will be behind a firewall in which case it must initiate the communications to request its configuration and supply an update on its status.

The `Remote is Accessible` field tells the _Plugin Manager_ which mode of operation is in use.

NOTE: Remote request of configuration is not yet fully implemented and will be completed in a future release.
