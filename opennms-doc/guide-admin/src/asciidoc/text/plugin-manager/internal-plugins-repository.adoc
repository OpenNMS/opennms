=== Installing Internal Plugins

_{opennms-product-name}_ is packaged with an internal repository of plugins which are shipped with the _{opennms-product-name}_ distribution. 
These plugins can be installed in the local _{opennms-product-name}_  _Karaf_ instance and activated by a user using the _Plugin Manager_ 
in the same way it could be used to download and install external plugins.

The _internal-plugin-descriptor_ feature maintains a list of internal plugins which are packaged with _{opennms-product-name}_. This list of internal
 plugins can be accessed by the _Plugin Manager_ by setting the `Available Plugins Server` to point to the local _{opennms-product-name}_ instance. To do this set
 `Plugin Server URL` to the address of the local _{opennms-product-name}_ (i.e. http:\\localhost:8980\opennms) and set the `Plugin Server Username` and `Plugin Server Password` to match the
_{opennms-product-name}_ ReST or admin username and password. 
  
Clicking `Reload available plugins` will then add the list of available internal plugins to the Available Plugins Tab where they
can be installed and started by the user as described previously. 

The internal plugins included with this _{opennms-product-name}_ release are documented in the next section.
