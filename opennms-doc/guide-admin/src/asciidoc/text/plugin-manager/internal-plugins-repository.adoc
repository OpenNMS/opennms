=== Installing Internal Plugins

_{opennms-product-name}_ is packaged with an internal repository of plugins which are can be installed in _Karaf_ 
and activated by a user using the _Plugin Manager_ in the same way it could be used to download external plugins.
The _internal-plugin-descriptor_ feature maintains a list of internal plugins which are packaged with _{opennms-product-name}_. 

The list of internal plugins can be accessed by setting the Available Plugins Server Plugin Server URL
 to the address of the local _{opennms-product-name}_ (i.e. http:\\localhost:8980\opennms) and clicking 'reload available plugins'. 
The available internal plugins will then be added to the Available Plugins Tab and can be installed and started by the user as described previously. 
(You should use the _{opennms-product-name}_ rest or admin username and password to access the local available plugins).

Example internal plugins included with _{opennms-product-name}_ are the _Alarm Change Notifier_ and the _Elasticsearch ReST Interface_.
