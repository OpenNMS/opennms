=== Installed Plugins

Under plugin settings, the Installed Plugins tab lists which plugins are currently installed in the _Karaf_ instance selected in the _Karaf_ instance data panel.
System Plugins cannot be uninstalled through the UI.
(The _Plugin Manager_ is itself a system plugin).
Non-system plugins can be reinstalled or removed from the system.
Each plugin has metadata associated with it which is used to identify and describe the plugin.

| Plugin Metadata        | Description
| Product ID             | The unique key used to identify the name and version of the feature.

| Licence Key Required   | If true (ticked), this plugin needs a licence key to start
| Licence Validated      | If a licence key is required, a green text label will indicate if the licence has been installed and validated. Otherwise a red text label will indicate an invalid licence
| System Plugin          | If true (ticked) this is a system plugin and cannot be removed.
| Packaging Descriptor   | This describes the packaging mechanism by which the feature was delivered. This will refer to a Kar if the feature was manually installed as a Kar/RPM on the host server.
| Feature Repository URL | The URL identifying the feature repository (Same as _Karaf_ Feature Repository URL)

NOTE: The installed plugins tab shows the data retrieved the last time the `Reload Karaf Instance` data button was pressed. (This allow us to maintain a record of offline 
_Karaf_ instances). However it also means that the localhost data may not be up to date with the local _Karaf_ instance. You should always reload to get the accurate picture of what is currently installed.

=== Available Plugins Server

The _Plugin Manager_ obtains a list of available plugins from the _Available Plugin's server_.

_Available Plugin's server_ can be part of an externally hosted plugin shopping cart or it can simply be a url serving the
internal list of available plugins as described in the section on Internal Plugins.
 
In order for externally downloaded plugins to be installed, the _Available Plugin's server_ must have a related maven repository from which
_Karaf_ can download the feature. By default feature download is not enabled in _{opennms-product-name}_. To enable _Karaf_ external
feature download, the address of the maven repository should be entered in the org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.cfg file in the 
_{opennms-product-name}_ /etc directory.

Alternatively the _Plugin Manager_ can list the available plugins which have been installed on the local machine as bundled Plugin Kar's 
(using the _Karaf_ Kar deploy mechanism) along with any internal plugins bundled with _{opennms-product-name}_.
In this case, the _Plugin Server URL_ should be pointed at http:\\localhost:8980\opennms.

The admin username and passwords are used to access the _Available Plugins Server_.
If a shopping cart is provided for obtaining licences, the URL of the shopping cart should be filled in.

=== Installing Available Plugins

The Available Plugins panel list the plugins which are available and listed by the Available Plugins server.
These can be directly installed into the selected _Karaf_ instance or can be posted to a manifest for later installation.
If a plugin is installed, the system will try and start it.
However if a corresponding licence is required and not installed, the features will be loaded but not started.
You must restart the feature if you later install a licence key.

=== Plugins Manifest

The Plugins Manifest for a given _Karaf_ instance lists the target plugins which the _Karaf_ instance should install when it next contacts the licence manager.
If the _Plugin Manager_ can communicate with the remote server, then a manifest can be selected for installation.
A manual manifest entry can also be created for a feature.
This can be used to install features which are not listed in the Available Features list.
