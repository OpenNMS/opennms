=== Installed Licences Panel

Each licence has a licence ID which is the _Karaf_ feature ID of the feature to which the licence refers.
Many licences can be installed on a system but only one licence string is allowed per feature ID.

Licence Strings are used to validate that a particular feature can be run on a given _Karaf_ instance.
The _Plugin Manager_ will not allow a feature to run if it's licence cannot be validated using a private key encoded in the feature bundle.

Licences are associated with specific Product ID's and specific _Karaf_ instances.
Several _Karaf_ instances can be listed in a licence allowing a feature to run on more than one system using the same licence.
When a licence is installed, the licence metadata is decoded and displayed.

NOTE: A licence may be installed before or after its associated feature is installed. 
If a licence is installed after the feature the feature must be restarted before the licence will be read.

=== Adding a New Licence

New licences are added using the add licence panel.
Licences are obtained from the _App Store_ where they can be generated by a user for a given set of system id's.

A licence must be copied (cut and paste) from the app store into the add licence panel.
The `Validate licence` button should be used to check the licence has been installed correctly.
Please note that this just checks the integrity of the licence string.
A licence is only authenticated once it is installed and the corresponding feature bundle checks it on start-up.
