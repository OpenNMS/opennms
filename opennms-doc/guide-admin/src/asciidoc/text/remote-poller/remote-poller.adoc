The _{opennms-product-name} Remote Poller_ allows an user to monitor the availability of a set of services from several remote locations.
These remote locations are called perspective locations in this context.
In order to configure remote polling an user has to define an application by associating a set of services and a set of perspectives from which these services should be monitored.

.Remote Poller operation

The _Remote Poller_ utilizes the minion infrastructure to monitor a service's availability from these different perspectives.
The service monitor configuration is looked up in the `poller-configuration.xml`.

NOTE: The `remote-only` flag in the package definition can be used to define packages that will be used *only* for remote polling.

When a service is not responsive an outage will be generated with the corresponding perspective.
In order to configure remote polling first an application has to be created.

.Create a new application

Next step is to configure the application.
In the upper section services that should be monitored from remote perspective locations can be associated with this application.
In the lower section the perspective locations from which the given services should be monitored can be defined.

.Configuration of an application

After configuring the application, the minions at the remote perspective locations start to monitor the services associated with this application.
The next screenshot show an HTTP outage noticed from all perspective locations and the _{opennms-product-name}_ instance itself.

.Remote outages

The column _Perspective_ shows the remote location from which a minion has detected this outage.
If no _Perspective_ is shown, the outage was detected by the normal process: the _{opennms-product-name}_ instance detected it in the _Default_ location or a minion detected it in the corresponding node's location.
