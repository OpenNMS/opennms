A number of _Karaf Shell_ commands are made available to help administer and diagnose issues related to performance data collection.

To use the commands, log into the _Karaf Shell_ on your system using:

[source]
----
ssh -p 8101 admin@localhost
----

NOTE: The Karaf shell uses the same credential as the web interface.
      Users must be associated with the `ADMIN` role to access the shell.
