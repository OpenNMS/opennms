=== Collection Packages

To define more complex collection configuration it is possible to group _Service_ configurations which provide performance metrics into _Collection Packages_.
They allow to assign to _Nodes_ different _Service Configurations_ to differentiate collection of performance metrics and connection settings.
To assign a _Collection Package_ to nodes the link:http://www.opennms.org/wiki/Filters[Rules/Filters] syntax can be used.

Multiple packages can be configured, and an interface can exist in more than one package.
This gives great flexibility how the service levels will be determined for a given device.
The order how _Collection Packages_ are defined is important when _IP Interfaces_ match multiple _Collection Packages_ with the same _Service_ configuration.
The last _Collection Package_ on the service will be applied.
This can be used to define a less specific catch all filter for a default configuration.
A more specific _Collection Package_ can be used to overwrite the default setting.

.Collection Package Attributes
[source, xml]
----
<package name="package1"<1>
  <filter>IPADDR != '0.0.0.0'</filter><2>
  <include-range begin="1.1.1.1" end="254.254.254.254"/><3>
  <include-range begin="::1" end="ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff"/><4>
----
<1> Unique name of the collection package.
<2> Apply this package to all _IP interfaces_ with a configured _IPv4_ address (not equal `0.0.0.0`)
<3> Evaluate _IPv4 rule_ to collect for all _IPv4 interfaces_ in the given range
<4> Evaluate _IPv6 rule_ to collect for all _IPv6 interfaces_ in the given range

==== Service Configurations

_Service Configurations_ define what _Collector_ to use and which performance metrics needs to be collected.
_Service Configurations_ contains common _Service Attributes_ as well as _Collector_ specific parameters.

.Service Configuration Attributes
[source, xml]
----
<service name="SNMP"<1>
         interval="300000"<2>
         user-defined="false"<3>
         status="on"<4>
  <parameter key="collection" value="default"/><5>
  <parameter key="thresholding-enabled" value="true"/><6>
</service>

<collector service="SNMP" class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.collectd.SnmpCollector"/><7>
----
<1> Service Configuration name which is mapped to a specific _Collector_ implementation.
<2> The interval at which the service is to be collected. (in milliseconds).
<3> Marker to say if service is user defined, used specifically for UI purposes.
<4> Service is collected only if on.
<5> Assign performance data collection metric groups named `default`.
<6> Enable threshold evaluation for metrics provided by this service.
<7> Run the _SnmpCollector_ implementation for the service named `SNMP`
