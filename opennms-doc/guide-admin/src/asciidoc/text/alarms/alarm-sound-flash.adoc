=== Alarm Sounds

Often users want an audible indication of a change in alarm state. 
The _{opennms-product-name}_ alarm list page has the optional ability to generate a sound either on each new alarm or (more annoyingly) on each change to an alarm event count on the page.

The figure <<ga-alarm-sounds-ui, Alarm Sounds View>> shows the alarm list page when alarms sounds are enabled.

By default the alarm sound feature is disabled. System Administrators must activate the sound feature and also set the default sound setting for all users.
However users can modify the default sound setting for the duration of their logged-in session using a drop down menu with the following options:

* Sound off: no sounds generated by the page.
* Sound on new alarm: sounds generated for every new alarm on the page.
* Sound on new alarm count: sounds generated for every increase in alarm event count for alarms on the page.

=== Flashing Unacknowledged Alarms 

By default _{opennms-product-name}_ displays the alarm list page with acknowledged and unacknowledged alarms listed in separate search tabs.
In a number of operational environments it is useful to see all of the alarms on the same page with unacknowledged alarms flashing to indicate that they haven't yet been noticed by one of the team.
This allows everyone to see at a glance the real time status of all alarms and which alarms still need attention.

The figure <<ga-alarm-sounds-ui, Alarm Sounds View>> also shows the alarm list page when flashing unacknowledged alarms are enabled.
Alarms which are unacknowledged flash steadily.
Alarms which have been acknowledged do not flash and also have a small tick beside the selection check box.
All alarms can be selected to be escalated, cleared, acknowledged and unacknowledged.

=== Configuring Alarm Sounds and Flashing

By default _{opennms-product-name}_ does not enable alarm sounds or flashing alarms. 
The default settings are included in opennms.properties.
However rather than editing the default opennms.properties file, the system administrator should enable these features by creating a new file in opennms.properties.d and applying the following settings;

`${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/opennms.properties.d/alarm.listpage.properties`

The sound played is determined by the contents of the following file `${OPENNMS_HOME}/jetty-webapps/opennms/sounds/alert.wav`

If you want to change the sound, create a new wav file with your desired sound, name it `alert.wav` and replace the default file in the same directory.
