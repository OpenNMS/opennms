[[ga-alarmd-introduction]]
_{opennms-product-name}_ has the ability to monitor the state of problems with its managed entities (ME), their resources, the services they provide, as well as the applications they host; or more simply, _the Network_.
In _{opennms-product-name}_, the state of these problems are characterized as _Alarms_.

.In the beginning, there were Events
Before Alarmd was created, OpenNMS' Events (or messages) were used not only as interprocess communication messages (IPC), but also as indications of problems in _the network_.
Even today, OpenNMS Events still carry problem state attributes such as: Acknowledgement and Severity.
However, these attributes have long since been functionally deprecated now that Alarms are used as _the_ indicator for problems in the network, (see also Situations and <<ga-bsm-introduction, Business Services>>).

IMPORTANT: A significant change occurred with the release of Horizon 23.0.0 (H23).
Prior to H23 and since the introduction of Alarms in OpenNMS, Alarmd was designed and configured to track the state of a problem using two Alarms; a _Down_ and an _Up_ Alarm.
Now, OpenNMS is designed with the intention to use a single Alarm to track the state of a problem.
The old behavior can be re-enabled by setting the system property org.opennms.alarmd.legacyAlarmState = true.

=== Single Alarm Tracking Problem States
.First occurrence of a Service Down problem (SNMP), Alarm instantiated

.The Service Down Event from the Poller (via clicking on Alarm count)

.Alarm is cleared immediately (no longer creating separate Alarm for Normal state)

.Both Service Down and Service restored Events from the Poller

.The Second occurence of the Service Down problem (SNMP), Alarm reduced

.The Alarm is again cleared immediately (notice counter doesn't increment)
