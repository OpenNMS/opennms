=== Alarm Service Daemon
Alarmd, the Alarm Service Daemon, has the very simple task of processing Events representing problems in the Network.
It either instantiates a new alarm for tracking a problem's state or reducing a reoccurring Event of an existing problem into the same Alarm.
(_Also known as Alarm de-duplication_)

Prior to OpenNMS Horizon version 23.0.0 (H23), Alarmd had no configuration.  With the release of H23, Drools is now imbedded directly inline with Alarmd's Event processing function.
This provides users with a more robust infrastructure for the effective management of workflow and problem states in the Network.
Business rules now replace the function of the ''Automations'' that were previously defined in Vacuumd's configuration.
You will find these new business rules in the etc/alarmd/drools-rules.d/ folder.
