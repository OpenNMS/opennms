The `Data Choices` module collects and publishes anonymous usage statistics to https://stats.opennms.org.

When a user with the `Admin` role logs into the system for the first time, they will be prompted as to whether or not they want to opt-in to publish these statistics.
Statistics will only be published once an `Administrator` has opted-in.

Usage statistics can later be disabled by accessing the 'Data Choices' link in the 'Admin' menu.

When enabled, the following anonymous statistics will be collected and publish on system startup and every 24 hours after:

* System ID (a randomly generated UUID)
* {opennms-product-name} Release
* {opennms-product-name} Version
* OS Architecture
* OS Name
* OS Version
. Number of Alarms in the `alarms` table
. Number of Events in the `events` table
. Number of IP Interfaces in the `ipinterface` table
. Number of Nodes in the `node` table
. Number of Nodes, grouped by System OID
