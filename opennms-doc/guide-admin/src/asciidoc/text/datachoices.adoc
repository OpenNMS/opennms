The first time a user with the `Admin` role logs into the system, a prompt appears for permission to allow the `Data Choices` module to collect and publish anonymous usage statistics to https://stats.opennms.org.

The OpenNMS Group uses this information to help determine product usage, and improve the {opennms-product-name} software.

Statisitcs collection and publication happen only once an admin user opts-in.

When enabled, the following anonymous statistics are collected and published on system startup and every 24 hours after:

* System ID (a randomly generated UUID)
* {opennms-product-name} Release
* {opennms-product-name} Version
* OS Architecture
* OS Name
* OS Version
* Number of alarms in the `alarms` table
* Number of events in the `events` table
* Number of IP interfaces in the `ipinterface` table
* Number of nodes in the `node` table
* Number of nodes, grouped by System OID

NOTE: You can enable or disable usage statistics collection at any time by choosing *admin>Configure OpenNMS>Additional Tools>Data Choices* and choosing *Opt-in* or *Opt-out* in the UI.
