=== Situation Feedback

==== Introduction

Situation Feedback allows operators to provide real time feedback on Alarm Correlation.

==== Installation

Situation Feedback needs to be enabled by installing the feature from the Karaf shell:

`feature:install opennms-situation-feedback`

==== Requirements

The feature requires Elasticsearch to persist the feeback records.

Installing the feature exposes a ReST enpoint that the HELM UI uses to display and submit feedback. 

Further information on the ReST API can be found in the <<gs-situation-feedback, Developer Guide>>
