The telemetry daemon (telemetryd) provides an extensible framework that can be used to handle sensor data pushed to _{opennms-product-name}_.
The framework can be used to implement support for a variety of applications which use different protocols to transfer metrics.
Using _telemetryd_, operators can define listeners supporting different protocols to receive the telemetry data and adapters transferring the received data into generic formats like flows or performance data.

The configuration is split in two parts.
_Listeners_ and attached _Parsers_ on one side, are responsible for receiving telemetry data transported over a specific protocol and parse the protocol according to its specification.
On the other side, _Adapters_ pick up the parsed data and enrich it before persisting it.

_Queues_ are used to transport the parsed telemetry data from _Parsers_ to _Adapters_ by binding a specific _Parser_ to a specific _Adapter_.

=== _Listeners_ and _Parsers_
_Listeners_ are responsible for receiving sensor data from some external source and hand them off to _Parsers_ which handles the transport protocol format and extracts the transported data.

A _Listener_ does the transport protocol handling like opening a socket and accepting incoming connections.
The received messages are then passed to the parser configured for the _Listener_ which parses the concrete protocol implementation and extract all available information out of the received message.
For further processing, the extracted data is handed over to the configured queue.

For example: A _Listener_ may open a UDP socket for receiving packets and a assigned _Parser_ parses the incoming IPFix packets.

_Parsers_ and _Listeners_ must work together in a tight manner.
Therefore they can not be combined in any possible combination.
Which _Parser_ is supported by which _Listener_ is described in the documentation of each _Parser_ accordingly.

=== _Adapters_
_Adapters_ are responsible for enriching and processing the data dispatched over a queue.
It receives the data from queue and transforms it into a format usable by _{opennms-product-name}_.
Adapters can also be used to enrich the incoming data to attach node or interface information depending on information already available.

For example: An _Adapter_ may be used to transform telemetry data received via SFlow into performance data and persist it to the according node.

As an _Adapter_ must handle data dependent to a transport protocol, not all _Adapters_ can be used in combination with any possible
_Parser_.
Which _Parsers_ are supported by which _Adapters_ is described in the documentation of each _Adapter_ accordingly.

TIP: In case you have multiple _Adapters_, the execution order is the same as defined in the `telemetryd-configuration.xml`.

=== _Queues_
_Queues_ are used to transfer data between _Parsers_ and _Adapters_ and are represented by a channel in the messaging system.

=== Push Sensor Data through Minion
_Listeners_ and its _Parsers_ may run on either _{opennms-product-name}_ or _Minion_, whereas adapters run on _{opennms-product-name}_ or _Sentinel_.
If a _Listener_ its _Parsers_ is running on _Minion_, the received messages will be automatically dispatched to the associated _Adapters_ running in _{opennms-product-name}_ or _Sentinel_ via a _Queue_.
