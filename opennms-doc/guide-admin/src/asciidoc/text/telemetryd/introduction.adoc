The telemetry daemon (telemetryd) provides an extensible framework you can use to handle sensor data pushed to _{opennms-product-name}_.
Use the framework to support applications that use different protocols to transfer metrics.
With _telemetryd_, operators can define listeners supporting different protocols to receive the telemetry data and adapters transferring the received data into generic formats like flows or performance data.

The configuration is split in two parts.
_Listeners_ and attached _Parsers_ or _Connectors_ on one side receive telemetry data transported over a specific protocol and parse the data according to protocol's specification.
On the other side, _Adapters_ pick up the parsed data and enrich it before persisting it.

_Queues_ transport the parsed telemetry data from _Parsers_ to _Adapters_ by binding a specific _Parser_ to a specific _Adapter_.

=== _Listeners_ and _Parsers_
_Listeners_ receive sensor data from an external source and hand them off to _Parsers_, which handle the transport protocol format and extract the transported data.

A _Listener_ does the transport protocol handling like opening a socket and accepting incoming connections.
The received messages are then passed to the parser configured for the _Listener_ which parses the concrete protocol implementation and extracts all available information out of the received message.
For further processing, the extracted data is handed over to the configured queue.

For example: a _Listener_ may open a UDP socket for receiving packets and an assigned _Parser_ parses the incoming IPFIX packets.

_Parsers_ and _Listeners_ must work together closely.
Therefore, they cannot be combined in any random way.
Which _Parser_ is supported by which _Listener_ is described in the documentation of each respective _Parser_.

=== Connectors

_Connectors_ initiate a connection and maintain a session with an agent. A new connector is created for every agent it is responsible for connecting to.
Agent here refers to an IP service that is a named service attached to an IP interface on a specific node.
Connectors don't use parsers, and dispatch messages directly to a queue.

=== _Adapters_
_Adapters_ enrich and process the data dispatched over a queue.
They receive the data from queue and transform it into a format usable by _{opennms-product-name}_.
Adapters can also enrich the incoming data to attach node or interface information, depending on information already available.

For example: an _Adapter_ may be used to transform telemetry data received via sFlow into performance data and persist it to the applicable node.

As an _Adapter_ must handle data dependent to a transport protocol, not all _Adapters_ can be used in combination with any possible
_Parser_.
Which _Parsers_ are supported by which _Adapters_ is described in the documentation of each respective _Adapter_.

TIP: If you have multiple _Adapters_, the execution order is the same as defined in the `telemetryd-configuration.xml`.

==== Working with Minions
Listeners and parsers run on Minion, but adapters do not. 
Adapters run on Sentinel, while the main {opennms-product-name} instance can run listeners, parsers, and adapters. 
When using Minion as a listener, you must use adapters on {opennms-product-name} or Sentinel to transform the data. 

=== _Queues_
_Queues_ transfer data between _Parsers_ and _Adapters_ and are represented by a channel in the messaging system.

==== Configuring _Queues_

The following options can help fine-tune queue behavior:

[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Queue attribute (OpenNMS) | Key (Minion/Sentinel)  | Description | Default value
| `threads`                 | `queue.threads`            | Number of threads used for consuming & dispatching messages. | (2 * number of cores)
| `queue-size`              | `queue.size`               | Maximum number of messages to keep in memory while waiting to be dispatched. | 10000
| `use-routing-key`         | `queue.use-routing-key`    | Whether to use the routing key when forwarding messages to the broker. This enforces ordering of the messages. | true
| `batch-size`              | `batch.size`               | Messages are aggregated in batches before being dispatched. When the batch reaches this size, it will be dispatched. | 1000
| `batch-interval`          | `batch.interval`           | Messages are aggregated in batches before being dispatched. When the batch has been created for longer than this interval (ms) it will be dispatched, regardless of the current size. | 500
|===

TIP: When using Kafka as a message broker, setting `use-routing-key` to `false` allows the messages to be balanced across all partitions.
This can be done safely for flows, but is not supported for metrics when using thresholding (order is required).

When setting these options in OpenNMS they can be added as an attribute to the `<queue>` element.
For example:
[source, xml]
----
<queue name="IPFIX" use-routing-key="false">
    ...
</queue>
----

When setting these options on Minion you can add them as `parser` properties, and on Sentinel as `adapter` properties:
[source]
----
name=IPFIX-Listener
class-name=org.opennms.netmgt.telemetry.listeners.UdpListener
parameters.host=0.0.0.0
parameters.port=4738
parsers.0.name=IPFIX
parsers.0.class-name=org.opennms.netmgt.telemetry.protocols.netflow.parser.IpfixUdpParser
parsers.0.queue.use-routing-key=false
----

=== Push Sensor Data through Minion
_Listeners_ and their _Parsers_ may run on either _{opennms-product-name}_ or _Minion_, whereas adapters run on _{opennms-product-name}_ or _Sentinel_.
If a _Listener_ and its _Parsers_ are running on _Minion_, the received messages will be automatically dispatched to the associated _Adapters_ running in _{opennms-product-name}_ or _Sentinel_ via a _Queue_.
Minions can listen (receive) data, but requires {opennms-product-name} or Sentinel to process.

[[telemetryd-reverse-hostname-resolution]]
=== Reverse hostname resolution
Some _Parsers_ support reverse hostname resolution to annotate IP addresses with the actual hostname.
The _Minion_ performs the reverse name lookup while parsing the protocol data.
The resolved hostname, if found, is attached to the address information and both are sent to the _Adapter_ for further processing.

For more information see <<ga-dnsresolver, DNS Resolver>>

The following _Parsers_ currently support reverse hostname resolution: Netflow v5, Netflow v9, IPFIX and sFlow.
