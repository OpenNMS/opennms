By default, the RMI port in the OpenNMS server is disabled, for security reasons.  If you wish to enable it so you can access OpenNMS through jconsole, remote-manage OpenNMS, or use the remote poller over RMI, you will have to add some settings to the default OpenNMS install.

=== Enabling RMI

To enable the RMI port in OpenNMS, you will have to add the following to the `${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/opennms.conf` file.  If you do not have an `opennms.conf` file, you can create it.

[source, bash, options="nowrap", opennms.conf]
----
# Configure remote JMX
ADDITIONAL_MANAGER_OPTIONS="$ADDITIONAL_MANAGER_OPTIONS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=18980"
ADDITIONAL_MANAGER_OPTIONS="$ADDITIONAL_MANAGER_OPTIONS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.local.only=false"
ADDITIONAL_MANAGER_OPTIONS="$ADDITIONAL_MANAGER_OPTIONS -Dopennms.poller.server.serverHost=0.0.0.0"
----

This tells OpenNMS to listen for RMI on port `18980`, and to listen on all interfaces.  (Originally, RMI was only used for the Remote Poller, so despite the porperty name mentioning the "opennms poller server" it applies to RMI as a whole.)  With this configuration, RMI is unauthenticated, so anyone is able to connect.

=== Enabling Authentication for RMI

To require authentication, you must add some additional configuration.

First, enable authentication for JMX in `opennms.conf` after the other settings:

[source, bash, options="nowrap"]
----
ADDITIONAL_MANAGER_OPTIONS="$ADDITIONAL_MANAGER_OPTIONS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=true"
----

This tells OpenNMS to enable authentication.  Authentication will only be allowed for users that are in the `admin` role.  To make a user an admin, add them to the `role.admin.users` entry in `${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/magic-users.properties`:

[options="nowrap"]
----
...

role.admin.name=OpenNMS Administrator
role.admin.users=admin,myuser

...
----

=== Creating Custom Authentication Roles

By default, RMI will only authenticate users in the `admin` role.  To create a custom role for RMI access, first add the role to `${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/magic-users.properties`:

[options="nowrap"]
----
...

# add mycustomrole to the end of the roles= entry
roles=rtc, admin, rouser, dashboard, provision, remoting, rest, asset, mobile, mycustomrole

# ...and then give it a name and a list of users
role.mycustomrole.name=OpenNMS Remote RMI User
role.mycustomrole.users=admin,myuser

...
----

Then, you must configure JMX to know about the new custom role by adding it to `${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/jmxremote.access`:

[options="nowrap"]
----
admin readwrite
mycustomrole readonly
----

The possible types of access are:

readwrite:: Allows retrieving JMX metrics as well as executing MBeans.
readonly:: Allows retrieving JMX metrics but does *not* allow executing MBeans, even if they just return simple values.
