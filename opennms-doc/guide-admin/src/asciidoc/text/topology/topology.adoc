This section describes how to configure the _Topology Map_.

=== Icons

Each Vertex on the _Topology Map_ is represented by an icon.
The default icon is configured in the icon mapping file: `${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/org.opennms.features.topology.app.icons.<topology-namespace>.cfg`.
If an icon mapping file does not exist for a _Topology Provider_, the provider does not support customization.

<2> Icon mapping for the Application Topology Provider
<3> Icon mapping for the Business Services Topology Provider
<4> Icon mapping for the Linkd Topology Provider
<5> Icon mapping for the Vmware Topology Provider

Each File contains a mapping in form of `<icon key> = <icon id>`.

Icon key::
A _Topology Provider_ dependent string which maps to an `icon id`.
An `icon key` consists of one to multiple `segments`.
Each segment must contain only numbers or characters.
If multiple `segments` exist they must be separated by `.`, e.g. `my.custom.key`.
Any existing default `icon keys` are not configurable and should not be changed.

Icon id::
The `icon id` is a unique icon identifier to reference an icon within one of the available SVG icons located in `${OPENNMS_HOME}/jetty-webapps/opennms/svg`.
For more details see <<ga-topology-add-icons>>.

==== Icon resolution

The icon of a vertex is resolved as follows:

 * If a `vertex id` to `icon id` mapping is defined, the icon referenced by the `icon id` is used
 * If a mapping for the `icon key` determined by the _Topology Provider_ for the vertex is defined, the icon referenced by the `icon id` is used
 ** If no mapping exists and the `icon key` has more than one `segments`, reduce the `icon key` by the last `segment` and try resolving that `icon key`
 * If no mapping is defined, the fallback `icon key` `default` is used.

The following example icon mapping is defined for the _Linkd Topology Provider_ to illustrate this behaviour.

[source]
----
linkd.system.snmp.1.3.6.1.4.1.9.1.485 = server1
linkd.system.snmp.1.3.6 = server2
----

If the Enterprise OID of a node is `1.3.6.1.4.1.9.1.485` the icon with id `server1` is used.
If the Enterprise OID of a node is `1.3.6` the icon with id `server2` is used.
However, if the Enterprise OID of a node is `1.3.6.1.4.1.9.1.13` the icon with id `server2` is used.

===== Linkd Topology Provider

The _Linkd Topology Provider_ uses the `Enterprise OID` from each node to determine the icon of a vertex.

==== Change existing icon mappings

The easiest way to change an icon representation of an existing Vertex is to use the _Icon Selection Dialog_ from the Vertex' context menu in the _Topology Map_.
This will create a custom `icon key` to `icon id` mapping in the _Topology Provider_ specific icon mapping file.
As `icon key` the Vertex id is used.
This allows each Vertex to have it's own icon.

If a more generic approach is preferred the icon mapping file can be modified manually.

WARNING: Do NOT remove the default mappings and do NOT change the icon keys in the default mappings.

==== Add new icons

All available icons are stored in SVG files located in `${OPENNMS_HOME}/jetty-webapps/opennms/svg`.
To add new icons, either add definitions to an existing SVG file or create a new SVG file in that directory.

Whatever way new icons are added to _OpenNMS_ it is important that each new `icon id` describes a set of icons, rather than a single icon.
The following example illustrates this.

[source,xml]
.Example SVG file with a custom icon with id `my-custom`
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">
<svg id="icons" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <g id="my-custom_icon"> <1>
      <g id="my-custom_active"> <2>
          <!-- rect, path, circle, etc elements, supported by SVG -->
      </g>
      <g id="my-custom_rollover"> <3>
          <!-- rect, path, circle, etc elements, supported by SVG -->
      </g>
      <g id="my-custom"> <4>
          <!-- rect, path, circle, etc elements, supported by SVG -->
      </g>
  </g>
  <!-- Additional groups ... -->
</svg>
----
<1> Each icon must be in a SVG group with the id `<icon id>_icon`.
Each SVG `<icon id>_icon` group must contain three sub groups with the ids: `<icon id>_active`, `<icon id>_rollover` and `<icon id>`.
<2> The icon to use when the Vertex is selected.
<3> The icon to use when the Vertex is moused over.
<4> The icon to use when the Vertex is not selected or not moused over (just visible).

NOTE: It is important that each `icon id` is unique overall SVG files. This means there cannot be another `my-custom` icon id in any other SVG file.

If the new icons should be selectable from the _Topology Map's Icon Selection Dialog_ an entry with the new `icon id` must be added to the file `${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/org.opennms.features.topology.app.icons.properties`.
