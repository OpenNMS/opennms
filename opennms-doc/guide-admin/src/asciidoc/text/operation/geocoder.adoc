=== Geocoder Service

The _Geocoder Service_ is used to resolve geolocation information within _{opennms-product-name}_.
_{opennms-product-name}_ supports several _Geocoder Services_.
By default geolocation resolution is disabled.

NOTE:   To enable or configure the _Geocoder Service_ please use the web based configuration tool.
        This can be found in the administration section: _Admin -> Configure Geocoder Service_

The currently used _Geocoder Service_ is configured via the property `activeGeocoderId` in `etc/org.opennms.features.geocoder.cfg`.
