== JMX Configuration Generator

_OpenNMS_ implements the _JMX_ protocol to collect long term performance data for _Java_ applications.
There are a huge variety of metrics available and administrators have to select which information should be collected.
The _JMX Configuration Generator Tools_ is build to help generating valid complex _JMX_ data collection configuration and _RRD graph_ definitions for _OpenNMS_.

This tool is available as CLI and a web based version.
