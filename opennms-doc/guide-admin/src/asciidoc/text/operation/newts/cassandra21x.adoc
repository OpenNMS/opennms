=== Cassandra monitoring

This section describes some of the metrics _OpenNMS_ collects for monitoring an _Apache Cassandra_ database infrastructure.
By default the category `Cassandra21x` is used to enable the data collection on a node.
Also, the service name `JMX-Cassandra21x` is used to bind this data collection to a node's interface.
The _JMXCollector_ is used to retrieve the _MBean_ entities from the _Cassandra_ node.

==== Thread pools

_Apache Cassandra_ is based on a so called _Staged Event Driven Architecture_ (SEDA).
This seperates different operations in stages and these stages are loosely coupled using a messaging service.
Each of these components use queues and thread pools to group and execute their tasks.
_OpenNMS_ collects the data for the following thread pools:

* AntiEntropyStage
* CacheCleanupExecutor
* CommitLogArchiver
* CompactionExecutor
* GossipStage
* HintedHandoff
* InternalResponseStage
* MemtableFlushWriter
* MemtablePostFlush
* MemtableReclaimMemory
* MigrationStage
* MiscStage
* PendingRangeCalculator
* Sampler
* ValidationExecutor
* CounterMutationStage
* MutationStage
* ReadRepairStage
* ReadStage
* RequestResponseStage
* Native-Transport-Requests

For each of these the following metrics are collected by _OpenNMS_:

[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Name | Description
| `ActiveTasks` | Tasks that are currently running
| `CompletedTasks` | Tasks that have been completed
| `CurrentlyBlockedTasks` | Tasks that have been blocked due to a full queue
| `PendingTasks` | Tasks queued for execution
| `TotalBlockedTasks` | Number of tasks that have been blocked in total
|===

==== Message dropped

Load shedding is part of the _Apache Cassandra_ architecture.
The number of dropped messages in the different message queues are good indicators whether a cluster can handle its load:

* COUNTER_MUTATION
* MUTATION
* PAGED_RANGE
* RANGE_SLICE
* READ
* READ_REPAIR
* REQUEST_RESPONSE
* _TRACE
* BINARY

==== Compaction manager

The following compaction manager metrics are monitored by _OpenNMS_:

[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Name | Description
| `BytesCompacted` | Number of bytes compacted since node started
| `CompletedTasks` | Estimated number of completed compaction tasks
| `PendingTasks` | Estimated number of pending compaction tasks
| `TotalCompactionsCompleted` | Total number of completed compaction tasks
|===

==== Storage

The following storage metrics are collected by _OpenNMS_:

[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Name | Description
| `Load` | Total disk space (in bytes) used by this node
| `Exceptions` | Number of unhandled exceptions since start of this _Cassandra_ instance
| `TotalHints` | The number of hints since the node was started
| `TotalHintsInProgress` | Number of hints currently active on this node
|===

==== Client connections

The number of client connections are also collected:

[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Name | Description
| `connectedNativeClients` | Metrics for connected native clients
| `connectedThriftClients` | Metrics for connected thrift clients
|===

==== JVM Metrics

Some key metrics from the running Java virtual machine are also collected:

java.lang:type=Memory::
  The memory system of the Java virtual machine. This includes heap and non-heap memory
java.lang:type=GarbageCollector,name=ConcurrentMarkSweep::
  Metrics for the garbage collection process of the Java virtual machine

TIP: If you use _Apache Cassandra_ for running _Newts_ you can also enable additional metrics for the _Newts_ keyspace.
