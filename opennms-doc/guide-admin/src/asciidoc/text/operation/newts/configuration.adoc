==== Configuration

===== Enabling Newts

_{opennms-product-name}_ can be configured to use Newts by setting the following property in in `${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/opennms.properties`:

[source]
----
org.opennms.timeseries.strategy=newts
----

It is also highly recommended that resources stored in _Newts_ are referenced by their foreign source and foreign ID, as opposed to their database ID.
To this end, the following property should also be set in the same file:

[source]
----
org.opennms.rrd.storeByForeignSource=true
----

With these set, _{opennms-product-name}_ will begin persisting metrics using the _Newts_ engine when restarted.

Additional configuration options are presented in the next section.

===== Configuration Reference

The following properties, found in `${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/opennms.properties`, can be used to configure and tune _Newts_.

===== Recommendations

You will likely want to change the values of `cache.max_entries` and the `ring_buffer_size` to suit your installation.

Meta-data related to resources are cached in order to avoid writing redundant records in _Cassandra_.
If you are collecting data from a large number of resources, you should increase the `cache.max_entries` to reflect the number of resources you are collecting from, with a suitable buffer.

The samples gathered by the collectors are temporarily stored in a ring buffer before they are persisted to _Cassandra_ using _Newts_.
The value of the `ring_buffer_size` should be increased if you expect large peaks of collectors returning at once or latency in persisting these to _Cassandra_.
However, note that the memory used by the ring buffer is reserved, and larger values may require an increased heap size.
