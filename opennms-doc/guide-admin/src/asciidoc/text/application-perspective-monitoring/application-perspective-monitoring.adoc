With {opennms-product-name} _Application Perspective Monitoring_ you can see the availability of a service hosted in Houston that is accessed in Seattle from your central location in New York.
If a service outage occurs, understanding the _perspective_ from which that outage was monitored makes it easier to troubleshoot the problem. 

Application Perspective Monitoring uses the Minion infrastructure to monitor a service's availability from these different perspectives.
When a service is not responsive an outage will be generated with the corresponding perspective.

The service monitor configuration is looked up in the `poller-configuration.xml`.

NOTE: Use the `perspective-only` flag in the package definition to define packages that will be used *only* for Application Perspective Monitoring.

==== Configuring Application Perspective Monitoring

Application Perspective Monitoring requires at least one {opennms-product-name} Minion on your network.
Refer to the xref:https://docs.opennms.org/opennms/releases/latest/guide-install/guide-install.html#_monitor_isolated_location_with_minion[Installation Guide] for more information. 

To configure Application Perspective Monitoring, create an application and then associate a set of services and perspectives from which to monitor those services with the application.

. Login to the web UI.
. Click the gear icon and select *Manage Applications*. 
. Specify a name for the application and click *Add New Application*.

.Create a new application

. Click the edit icon. 
. In the upper section, select the services you want to monitor from perspective locations with this application.
. In the lower section, select the perspective locations from which to monitor the specified services.

.Application configuration

After configuring the application, Minions at the perspective locations start to monitor the services associated with this application.
The next link:#apm-perspective-outages[figure] shows an HTTP outage noticed from all perspective locations and the _{opennms-product-name}_ poller daemon itself.

.Perspective outages

The *Perspective* column shows the perspective location from which a Minion has detected this outage.
An empty *Perspective* column indicates that the normal process detected the outage: either the _{opennms-product-name}_ instance detected it in the default location or a Minion detected it in the corresponding node's location.
