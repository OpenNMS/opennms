_{opennms-product-name}_ _Application Perspective Monitoring_ allows a user to monitor the availability of a set of services from several remote locations.
These remote locations are called perspective locations in this context.
To configure _Application Perspective Monitoring_ a user has to define an application by associating a set of services and a set of perspectives from which to monitor these services with the application.

.Application Perspective Monitoring operation

_Application Perspective Monitoring_ uses the Minion infrastructure to monitor a service's availability from these different perspectives.
The service monitor configuration is looked up in the `poller-configuration.xml`.

NOTE: Use the `remote-only` flag in the package definition to define packages that will be used *only* for _Application Perspective Monitoring_.

When a service is not responsive an outage will be generated with the corresponding perspective.
To configure _Application Perspective Monitoring_ you must first create an application.

.Create a new application

Next step is to configure the application.
In the upper section services that should be monitored from remote perspective locations can be associated with this application.
In the lower section, users can define the perspective locations from which the given services should be monitored.

.Configuration of an application

After configuring the application, Minions at the perspective locations start to monitor the services associated with this application.
The next screenshot shows an HTTP outage noticed from all perspective locations and the _{opennms-product-name}_ poller daemon itself.

.Remote outages

The column _Perspective_ shows the remote location from which a minion has detected this outage.
An empty *Perspective* column indicates that the normal process detected the outage: either the _{opennms-product-name}_ instance detected it in the default location or a Minion detected it in the corresponding node's location.
