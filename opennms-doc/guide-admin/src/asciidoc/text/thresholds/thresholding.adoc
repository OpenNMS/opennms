[[ga-threshd-introduction]]
_{opennms-product-name}_ has the ability to monitor the performance of a managed entity's resource(s) by using various thresholding techniques.
These techniques, or algorithms, can be applied against any performance data (telemetry) that has been collected by <<ga-performance-mgmt,collectd>> or has been pushed to <<ga-telemetryd, telemetryd>>.
This includes, but is not limited to metrics such as: CPU Load, Bandwidth, Disk space, etc.

There are a few basic thresholding algorithms available within OpenNMS:

* High
* Low
* Absolute Value
* Relative Change

=== Thresholding Service

The Thresholding Service is the component responsible for maintaining the state of the performance metrics and for generating alarms from these when thresholds are triggered (armed) or cleared (unarmed).

The thresholding services listens for and visits performance metrics _after_ they are persisted to the time series database.

The state of the thresholds are held in memory and pushed to persistent storage only when they are changed.

==== Distributed Thresholding with Sentinel

Thresholding for streaming telemetry with <<ga-telemetryd, telemetryd>> is supported on Sentinel when using <<ga-opennms-operation-newts, Newts>>.
When running on Sentinel, the thresholding state can be stored in either Cassandra or PostgreSQL.
Given that Newts already requires Cassandra, we recommend using Casssandra in order to help minimize the load on PostgreSQL.

Thresholding on Sentinel uses the same configuration files as _{opennms-product-name}_ and operates similarly.
When a thresholding changes to/from trigger or cleared, and event is published which is processed by _{opennms-product-name}_ and the alarm is created or updated.

=== Shell Commands

The following shell commands are made available to help debug and manage thresholding.

Enumerate the persisted threshold states using `opennms:threshold-enumerate`:

[source]
----
admin@opennms> opennms:threshold-enumerate 
Index   State Key
1       23-127.0.0.1-hrStorageIndex-hrStorageUsed / hrStorageSize * 100.0-/opt/opennms/share/rrd/snmp-RELATIVE_CHANGE
2       23-127.0.0.1-if-ifHCInOctets * 8 / 1000000 / ifHighSpeed * 100-/opt/opennms/share/rrd/snmp-HIGH
3       23-127.0.0.1-node-((loadavg5 / 100) / CpuNumCpus) * 100.0-/opt/opennms/share/rrd/snmp-HIGH
4       23-127.0.0.1-if-ifInDiscards + ifOutDiscards-/opt/opennms/share/rrd/snmp-HIGH
----

Each state is uniquely identified by a `state key` and aliased by the given `index`.
Indexes are scoped to the particular shell session and provided as an alternative to specifying the complete state key in subsequent commands.

Display state details using `opennms:threshold-details`:

[source]
----
admin@opennms> opennms:threshold-details 1
multiplier=1.333
lastSample=64.77758166043765
previousTriggeringSample=28.862826722171075
interpolatedExpression='hrStorageUsed / hrStorageSize * 100.0'
----

[source]
----
admin@opennms> opennms:threshold-details 2
exceededCount=0
armed=true
interpolatedExpression='ifHCInOctets * 8 / 1000000 / ifHighSpeed * 100'
----

NOTE: Different types of thresholds will display different properties.

Clear a particular persisted state using `opennms:threshold-clear`:

[source]
----
admin@opennms> opennms:threshold-clear 2
----

Or clear all the persisted states with `opennms:threshold-clear-all`:

[source]
----
admin@opennms> opennms:threshold-clear-all 
Clearing all thresholding states....done
