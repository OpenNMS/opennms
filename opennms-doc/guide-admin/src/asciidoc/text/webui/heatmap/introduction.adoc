=== Heatmap

The _Heatmap_ can be either be used to display unacknowledged alarms or to display ongoing outages
of nodes. Each of this visualizations can be applied either on categories or on foreign sources of
nodes. The sizing of an entity is calculated by counting the monitored services inside the entity.
Thus, a node with fewer services will appear in a smaller box than a node with more services.

The feature is by default deactivated and is configured through `opennms.properties`.

| Name                                       | Type      | Description                                                  | Default
| `org.opennms.heatmap.defaultMode`          | _String_  | There exist two options for using the heatmap: `alarms` and
                                                           `outages`. This option configures which are displayed per
                                                           default.
                                                                                                                        | `alarms`
| `org.opennms.heatmap.defaultHeatmap`       | _String_  | This option defines which _Heatmap_ is displayed by default.
                                                           The two valid options are `categories` or `foreignSources`   | `categories`
| `org.opennms.heatmap.categoryFilter`       | _String_  | The following option is used to filter for categories to be
                                                           displayed in the _Heatmap_. This option uses the Java regular
                                                           expression syntax. The default is `.*` so all categories will
                                                           be displayed.                                                | `.*`
| `org.opennms.heatmap.foreignSourceFilter`  | _String_  | The following option is used to filter for foreign sources
                                                           to be displayed in the _Heatmap_. This option uses the Java
                                                           regular expression syntax. The default is `.*` so all foreign
                                                           sources will be displayed.                                   | `.*`
| `org.opennms.heatmap.onlyUnacknowledged`   | _Boolean_ | This option configures whether only unacknowledged alarms
                                                           will be taken into account when generating the alarm-based
                                                           version of the _Heatmap_.                                    | `false`
| `org.opennms.web.console.centerUrl`        | _String_  |  You can also place the _Heatmap_ on the landing page by
                                                           setting this option to `/heatmap/heatmap-box.jsp`.           | `/surveillance-box.jsp`

TIP: You can use negative lookahead expressions for excluding categories you wish not to be displayed in the heatmap,
e.g. by using an expression like `^(?!XY).*` you can filter out entities with names starting with `XY`.
