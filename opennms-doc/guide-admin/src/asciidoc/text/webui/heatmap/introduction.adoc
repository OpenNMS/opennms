The _Heatmap_ can be either be used to display unacknowledged alarms or to display ongoing outages of nodes.
Each of this visualizations can be applied on categories, foreign sources or services of nodes.
The sizing of an entity is calculated by counting the services inside the entity.
Thus, a node with fewer services will appear in a smaller box than a node with more services.

The feature is by default deactivated and is configured through `opennms.properties`.

TIP: You can use negative lookahead expressions for excluding categories you wish not to be displayed in the heatmap,
e.g. by using an expression like `^(?!XY).*` you can filter out entities with names starting with `XY`.
