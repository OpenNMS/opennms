==== Web based utility

Complex _JMX_ data collection configurations can be generated from a web based tool.
It collects all available _MBean Attributes_ or _Composite Data Attributes_ from a _JMX_ enabled Java application.

The workflow of the tool is:

. Connect with _JMX_ or _JMXMP_ against a _MBean Server_ provided of a _Java_ application
. Retrieve all _MBean_ and _Composite Data_ from the application
. Select specific _MBeans_ and _Composite Data_ objects which should be collected by _{opennms-product-name}_
. Generate _JMX Collectd_ configuration file and _RRD graph_ definitions for _{opennms-product-name}_ as downloadable archive

The following connection settings are supported:

* Ability to connect to _MBean Server_ with _RMI_ based _JMX_
* Authentication credentials for _JMX_ connection
* Optional: JMXMP connection

The web based configuration tool can be used in the _{opennms-product-name} Web Application_ in administration section _Admin -> JMX Configuration Generator_.

===== Configure JMX Connection

At the beginning the connection to an _MBean Server_ of a _Java_ application has to be configured.

.JMX connection configuration window

* _Service name_: The name of the service to bind the _JMX_ data collection for _Collectd_
* _Host_: IP address or _FQDN_ connecting to the _MBean Server_ to load _MBeans_ and _Composite Data_ into the generation tool
* _Port_: Port to connect to the _MBean Server_
* _Authentication_: Enable / Disable authentication for _JMX_ connection with username and password
* _Skip non-number values_: Skip attributes with non-number values
* _JMXMP_: Enable / Disable _JMX Messaging Protocol_ instead of using _JMX_ over _RMI_

By clicking the arrow ( _>_ ) the _MBeans_ and _Composite Data_ will be retrieved with the given connection settings.
The data is loaded into the _MBeans Configuration_ screen which allows to select metrics for the data collection configuration.

===== Select MBeans and Composite

The _MBeans Configuration_ section is used to assign the _MBean_ and _Composite Data attributes_ to _RRD domain_ specific data types and data source names.

The left sidebar shows the tree with the _JMX Domain_, _MBeans_ and _Composite Data_ hierarchy retrieved from the _MBean Server_.
To select or deselect all attributes use _Mouse right click -> select/deselect_.

The right panel shows the _MBean Attributes_ with the _RRD_ specific mapping and allows to select or deselect specific _MBean Attriubtes_ or _Composite Data Attributes_ for the data collection configuration.

.Configure Composite attributes for data collection configuration
image::operation/jmx-config-generator/04-webui-composite-details.png[]

* _MBean Name_ or _Composite Alias_: Identifies the _MBean_ or the _Composite Data_ object
* _Selected_: Enable/Disable the _MBean attribute_ or _Composite Member_ to be included in the data collection configuration
* _Name_: Name of the _MBean attribute_ or _Composite Member_
* _Alias_: the _data source name_ for persisting measurements in _RRD_ or _JRobin_ file
* _Type_: _Gauge_ or _Counter_ data type for persisting measurements in _RRD_ or _JRobin_ file

The _MBean Name_, _Composite Alias_ and _Name_ are validated against special characters.
For the _Alias_ inputs are validated to be not longer then 19 characters and have to be unique in the data collection configuration.

===== Download and include configuration

The last step is generating the following configuration files for _{opennms-product-name}_:

* _collectd-configuration.xml_: Generated sample configuration assigned to a service with a matching data collection group
* _jmx-datacollection-config.xml_: Generated _JMX_ data collection configuration with the selected _MBeans_ and _Composite Data_
* _snmp-graph.properties_: Generated default _RRD_ graph definition files for all selected metrics

The content of the configuration files can be copy & pasted or can be downloaded as _ZIP archive_.

NOTE: If the content of the configuration file exceeds 2,500 lines, the files can only be downloaded as _ZIP archive_.
