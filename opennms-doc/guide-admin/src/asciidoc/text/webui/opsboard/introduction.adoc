In a network operation center _(NOC)_ the _Ops Board_ can be used to visualize monitoring information.
The monitoring information for various use-cases are arranged in configurable _Dashlets_.
To address different user groups it is possible to create multiple _Ops Boards_.

There are two visualisation components to display _Dashlets_:

 * _Ops Panel_: Shows multiple _Dashlets_ on one screen, e.g. on a NOC operators workstation
 * _Ops Board_: Shows one _Dashlet_ at a time in rotation, e.g. for a screen wall in a NOC

 5. List of available _Dashlets_
 6. _Priority_ for this _Dashlet_ in _Ops Board_ rotation, lower priority means it will be displayed more often
 7. _Duration_ in seconds for this _Dashlet_ in the _Ops Board_ rotation
 8. Change _Priority_ if the _Dashlet_ is in alert state, this is optional and maybe not available in all _Dashlets_
 9. Change _Duration_ if the _Dashlet_ is in alert state, it is optional and maybe not available in all _Dashlets_
