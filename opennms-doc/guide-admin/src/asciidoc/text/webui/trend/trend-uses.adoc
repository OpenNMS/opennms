### Embedding a Trend box

You can also display a single graph in your JSP files by including the file `/trend/single-trend-box.jsp` and specifying the `name` parameter.

### Home Page Graphs

There are two files that could be added to the `org.opennms.web.console.centerURL` property for use on the home page.  These are `/trend/single-trend-box.jsp` and `/trend/multi-trend-box.jsp`.  The latter has some default trends specified, but can be customized by setting `org.opennms.trendbox.box1` through `org.opennms.trendbox.box4` in opennms.properties to match trends you have defined in `trend-configuration.xml`.
