=== Configuring system proxies

System proxy settings may be used with certain _{opennms-product-name}_ components via the `use-system-proxy` or `useSystemProxy` parameters.
To configure system proxy servers, set some or all of the following properties:

[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Property                      | Default    | Description
| `http.proxyHost`              | None       | Hostname or IP address of proxy server to use for plain HTTP requests
| `http.proxyPort`              | 3128       | TCP port of proxy server to use for plain HTTP requests
| `https.proxyHost`             | None       | Hostname or IP address of proxy server to use for HTTPS requests
| `https.proxyPort`             | 3128       | TCP port of proxy server to use for HTTPS requests
| `http.nonProxyHosts`          | None       | Pipe-separated list of hostnames or IP addresses which bypass HTTP proxying
| `https.nonProxyHosts`         | None       | Pipe-separated list of hostnames or IP addresses which bypass HTTPS proxying
|===

TIP: Depending on the JVM in use, the properties `http.proxyUser`, `http.proxyPassword`, and their `https.*` equivalents _may_ enable the use of proxy servers that require authentication.

WARNING: Setting these properties may have unintended effects. Use with care.
