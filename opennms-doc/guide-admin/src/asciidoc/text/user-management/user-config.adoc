=== User Creation and Configuration

Only a user with admin privileges can create users and assign security roles to them. 
We recommend creating a new user with admin privileges instead of using the default `admin` (see link:#ga-admin-user-setup[Admin User Setup]).

Ideally, each user account corresponds to a person, to help track who performs tasks in your {opennms-product-name} system.
Assigning different link:#ga-role-user-management-roles[security roles] to each user helps restrict what tasks the user can perform. 

In addition to local users, you can configure external authentication services including link:https://wiki.opennms.org/wiki/Spring_Security_and_LDAP[LDAP / LDAPS], link:https://wiki.opennms.org/wiki/Spring_Security_and_Radius[RADIUS], and link:https://wiki.opennms.org/wiki/Single_Sign_On[SSO].
Configuration specifics for these services are outside the scope of this documentation.

WARNING: Do not delete the default _admin_ and _rtc_ users.
         The _rtc_ user is used for the communication of the Real-Time Console on the start page to calculate the node and service availability.

     Add the _ROLE_ADMIN_ role to create a new admin.

==== Create User Duty Schedule

A duty schedule specifies the days and times a user (or group) receives notifications, on a per-week basis. 
This feature allows you to customize a schedule based on your team's hours of operation.  
Schedules are additive: a user could have a regular work schedule, and a second schedule for days or weeks when they are on call.

If {opennms-product-name} needs to notify an individual user, but that user is not on duty at the time, it will never send the notification to that user.

Notifications sent to users in groups are different:

* group on duty at time of notification – all users also on duty receive notification
* group on duty, no member users on duty – notification is queued and sent to the next user who comes on duty
* off-duty group – notification never sent

To add a duty schedule for a user (or group), follow these steps:

. Log in as a user with administrative permissions.
. Click the gear icon in the top-right. 
. Choose *Configure OpenNMS -> Configure Users, Groups and On-Call roles* and select *Configure Users* (*Configure Groups*).
. Choose the user (or group) you want to modify. 
. In the *Duty Schedule* area, select the number of schedules you want to add from the drop-down and click *Add Schedule*. 
. Specify the days and times during which you want the user (or group) to receive notifications. 
. Click *Finish*.
