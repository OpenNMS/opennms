[[ga-on-call-role]]
The on-call roles feature allows you to assign a predefined link:#ga-user-schedule[duty schedule] to an existing group of users.
A common use case is to have system engineers in on-call rotations with a given schedule.

Each on-call role includes a user designated as a supervisor, who receives notifications when no one is on duty to receive {opennms-product-name} notifications. 
The supervisor must have `admin` privileges.
