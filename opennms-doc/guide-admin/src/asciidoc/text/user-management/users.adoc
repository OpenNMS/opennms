_Users_ are entities with login accounts in the _{opennms-product-name}_ system.
Ideally each user corresponds to a person.
An _{opennms-product-name}_ _User_ represents an actor which may be granted permissions in the system by associating _Security Roles_.
_{opennms-product-name}_ stores by default _User_ information and credentials in a local embedded file based storage.
Credentials and user details, e.g. contact information, descriptions or _Security Roles_ can be managed through the _Admin Section_ in the Web User Interface.

Beside local _Users_, external link:https://wiki.opennms.org/wiki/Spring_Security_and_LDAP[LDAP] service and link:https://wiki.opennms.org/wiki/Single_Sign_On[SSO] can be configured, but are not scope in this section.
The following paragraphs describe how to manage the embedded _User_ and _Security Roles_ in _{opennms-product-name}_.

=== Users

Managing _Users_ is done through the _Web User Interface_ and requires to login as a _User_ with administrative permissions.
By default the _admin_ user is used to initially create and modify _Users_.
The _User_, _Password_ and other detail descriptions are persisted in `users.xml` file.
It is not required to restart _{opennms-product-name}_ when _User_ attributes are changed.

In case administrative tasks should be delegated to an _User_ the _Security Role_ named _ROLE_ADMIN_ can be assigned.

IMPORTANT: Change the default _admin_ password to a secure password.
