=== Web UI Pre-Authentication

It is possible to configure _{opennms-product-name}_ to run behind a proxy that provides authentication, and then pass the pre-authenticated user to the _{opennms-product-name}_ webapp using a header.

The pre-authentication configuration is defined in `$OPENNMS_HOME/jetty-webapps/opennms/WEB-INF/spring-security.d/header-preauth.xml`. This file is automatically included in the Spring Security context, but is not enabled by default.

WARNING: *DO NOT* configure _{opennms-product-name}_ in this manner unless you are certain the web UI is only accessible to the proxy and not to end-users.
	Otherwise, malicious attackers can craft queries that include the pre-authentication header and get full control of the web UI and ReST APIs.

==== Enabling Pre-Authentication

Edit the `header-preauth.xml` file, and set the `enabled` property:

[source,xml]
----
<beans:property name="enabled" value="true" />
----

==== Configuring Pre-Authentication

There are a number of other properties that can be set to change the behavior of the pre-authentication plugin.

[options="header"]
[cols="1,3,2"]
|====
| Property
| Description
| Default

| enabled
| Whether the pre-authentication plugin is active.
| false

| failOnError
| If true, disallow login if the header is not set or the user does not exist. If false, fall through to other mechanisms (basic auth, form login, and so on.)
| false

| userHeader
| The HTTP header that will specify the user to authenticate as.
| X-Remote-User

| credentialsHeader
| A comma-separated list of credentials to associate with the principal. If specified, the header must be set for authentication to be successful.
| n/a

| authoritiesHeader
| The HTTP header that will contain a comma-separated list of authorities (roles) the user will have.
| n/a
|====

== Enabling pre-authorization

Modify `jetty-webapps/opennms/WEB-INF/applicationContext-spring-security.xml`, and set:

[source,xml]
---
<beans:bean id="preauthAuthProvider" class="org.springframework.security.web.authentication.preauth.PreAuthenticatedAuthenticationProvider">
  <beans:property name="preAuthenticatedUserDetailsService">
    <beans:bean id="preAuthUserDetailsService" class="org.springframework.security.web.authentication.preauth.PreAuthenticatedGrantedAuthoritiesUserDetailsService"/>
  </beans:property>
</beans:bean>
---


You can then try testing with:
```
curl -H "X-Remote-User: myuser" -H "X-Remote-Role: ROLE_USER,ROLE_REST" http://localhost:8980/opennms/rest/whoami
```
