== Events in OpenNMS

=== Events

Events are central to the operation of the OpenNMS platform, so it's critical to have a firm grasp of this topic.

IMPORTANT: Whenever something in OpenNMS appears to work by magic, it's probably events working behind the curtain.

==== Anatomy of an Event

Events are structured historical records of things that happen in OpenNMS and the nodes, interfaces, and services it manages.
Every event has a number of fixed *fields* and zero or more *parameters*.

.Mandatory Fields
UEI (Universal Event Identifier)::
    A string uniquely identifying the event's type.
    UEIs are typically formatted in the style of a URI, but the only requirement is that they start with the string `uei.`.
Event Label::
    A short, static label summarizing the gist of all instances of this event.
Description::
    A long-form description describing all instances of this event.
Log Message::
    A long-form log message describing this event, optionally including expansions of fields and parameters so that the value is tailored to the event at hand.
Severity::
    A severity for this event type.
    Possible values range from `Cleared` to `Critical`.
Event ID::
    A numeric identifier used to look up a specific event in the OpenNMS system.

.Notable Optional Fields
Operator Instruction::
    A set of instructions for an operator to respond appropriately to an event of this type.
Alarm Data::
    If this field is provided for an event, OpenNMS will create, update, or clear *alarms* for events of that type according to the alarm-data specifics.
    For more about alarms and how they relate to events, see <<alarms-introduction>>.

==== Sources of Events

Events may originate within OpenNMS itself or from outside.

Internally-generated events can be the result of the platform's monitoring and management functions (_e.g._ a monitored node becoming totally unavailable results in an event with the UEI `uei.opennms.org/nodes/nodeDown`) or they may act as inputs or outputs of housekeeping processes.

Externally-created events can arrive by a variety of mechanisms, including:

.External Event Mechanisms
SNMP Traps::
    If SNMP-capable devices in the network are configured to send *traps* to OpenNMS, these traps are transformed into events according to pre-configured rules.
    Event definitions are included with OpenNMS for traps from many vendors' equipment.
Syslog Messages::
    Syslog messages sent over the network to OpenNMS can be transformed into events according to pre-configured rules.
TL1 Autonomous Messages::
    Autonomous messages can be retrieved from certain TL1-enabled equipment and transformed into events.
XML-TCP::
    Any application or script can create custom events in OpenNMS by sending properly-formatted XML data over a TCP socket.

[[section-events-event-bus]]
==== The Event Bus

At the heart of OpenNMS lies an *event bus*.
Any OpenNMS component can _publish_ events to the bus, and any component can _subscribe_ to receive events of interest that have been published on the bus.
This publish-subscribe model enables components to use events as a mechanism to send messages to each other.
For example, the provisioning subsystem of OpenNMS publishes a _node-added_ event whenever a new node is added to the system.
Other subsystems with an interest in new nodes subscribe to the _node-added_ event and automatically receive these events, so they know to start monitoring and managing the new node if their configuration dictates.
The publisher and subscriber components do not need to have any knowledge of each other, allowing for a clean division of labor and lessening the programming burden to add entirely new OpenNMS subsystems or modify the behavior of existing ones.
