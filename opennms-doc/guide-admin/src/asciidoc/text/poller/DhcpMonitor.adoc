| Parameter          | Description                                                                       | Required           | Default value
| `port`             | Defines the port your dhcp server is using                                        | required           | `5818`                   
| `macAddress`       | The MAC address which OpenNMS uses for a dhcp request                             | required           | `don't know`
| `myIpAddress`      | This parameter will usually be set to the ip address of the OpenNMS server,
                       which puts the DHCP poller in `relay` mode as opposed to `broadcast` mode.
                       In `relay` mode, the DHCP server being polled will unicast its responses directly
                       back to the ip address specified by `myIpAddress` rather than broadcasting its
                       responses. This allows DHCP servers to be polled even though they are not on the
                       same subnet as the OpenNMS server, and without the aid of an external relay.
                       _Usage:_ `myIpAddress="10.11.12.13"` or `myIpAddress="broadcast"`                 | required           | `broadcast`
| `extendedMode`     | When extendedMode is false, the DHCP poller will send a DISCOVER and expect an
                       OFFER in return. When extendedMode is true, the DHCP poller will first send a
                       DISCOVER. If no valid response is received it will send an INFORM. If no valid
                       response is received it will then send a REQUEST. OFFER, ACK, and NAK are all
                       considered valid responses in extendedMode.
                       _Usage:_ `extendedMode="true"` or `extendedMode="false"`                          | required           | `false`
| `requestIpAddress` | This parameter only applies to REQUEST queries sent to the DHCP server when
                       extendedMode is true. If an ip address is specified, that ip address will be
                       requested in the query. If `targetHost` is specified, the DHCP server's own ip
                       address will be requested. Since a well-managed server will probably not respond
                       to a request for its own ip, this parameter can also be set to `targetSubnet`.
                       This is similar to `targetHost` except the DHCP server's ip address is
                       incremented or decremented by 1 to obtain an ip address that is on the same
                       subnet.
                       (The resulting address will not be on the same subnet if the DHCP server's
                       subnet is a /32 or /31. Otherwise, the algorithm used should be reliable.)
                       _Usage:_ `requestIpAddress="10.77.88.99"` or `requestIpAddress="targetHost"`
                       or `requestIpAddress="targetSubnet"`                                              | required           | `false`

==== Hint

*Caution on usage:* If in `extendedMode`, the time required to complete the poll for an unresponsive node is increased by a factor of 3.
                    Thus it is a good idea to limit the number of retries to a small number.
