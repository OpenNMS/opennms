=== Remedy Ticketing Plugin

The _Remedy Ticketing Plugin_ is used to create requests in the BMC Remedy ARS Help Desk Module in response to _{opennms-product-name}_ alarms.

==== Remedy Product Overview
It's important to be specific when discussing Remedy, because BMC Remedy is a suite of products.
The _{opennms-product-name}_ Remedy Ticketing Plugin requires the core Remedy ARS and the Help Desk Module.
The Help Desk Module contains a Help Desk Interface Web Service, which serves as the endpoint for creating, updating, and fetching tickets.

The Help Desk Interface (HDI) Web Service requires extensive configuration for its basic operation, and may need additional customization to interoperate with the _{opennms-product-name}_ Remedy Ticketing Plugin.
Contact your Remedy administrator for help with required configuration tasks.

==== Supported Remedy Product Versions
Currently supported Remedy product versions are listed below:

==== Setup

The Remedy Ticketing Plugin and its dependencies are part of the _{opennms-product-name}_ core packages.

Start by enabling the plugin and the ticket controls in the _{opennms-product-name}_ web interface, by setting the following properties in `${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/opennms.properties`:

[source]
----
opennms.ticketer.plugin=org.opennms.netmgt.ticketer.remedy.RemedyTicketerPlugin
opennms.alarmTroubleTicketEnabled = true
----

In the same file, set the property `opennms.alarmTroubleTicketLinkTemplate` to a value appropriate for constructing a link to tickets in the Remedy web interface.
A sample value is provided but must be customized for your site; the token `${id}` will be replaced with the Remedy ticket ID when the link is rendered.

Now configure the plugin itself by setting the following properties in `${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/remedy.properties`:
