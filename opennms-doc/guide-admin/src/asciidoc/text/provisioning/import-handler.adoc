=== Import Handlers

The new Provisioning service in {opennms-product-name} is continuously improving and adapting to the needs of the community.

One of the most recent enhancements to the system is built upon the very flexible and extensible API of referencing an import requisition's location via a URL.
Most commonly, these URLs are files on the file system (i.e. `file:/opt/opennms/etc/imports/<my-provisioning-group.xml>`) as requisitions created by the Provisioning Groups UI.
However, these same requisitions for adding, updating, and deleting nodes (based on the original model importer) can also come from URLs.
For example a requisition can be retrieving the using HTTP protocol: http://myinventory.server.org/nodes.cgi

In addition to the standard protocols supported by Java, we provide a series of custom URL handlers to help retrieve requisitions from external sources.

==== Generic Handler

The generic handler is made available using URLs of the form: requisition://type?param=1;param=2

Using these URLs various type handlers can be invoked, both locally and via a _Minion_.

In addition to the type specific parameters, the following parameters are supported:

.General parameters
[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Parameter              | Description                                                                    | Required | Default value
| `location`             | The name of location at which the handler should be run                        | optional | Default
| `ttl`                  | The maximum number of miliseconds to wait for the handler when ran remotely    | optional | 20000
|===

See the relevant sections bellow for additional details on the support types.

The `provision:show-import` command available via the _Karaf Shell_ can be used to show the results of an import (without persisting or triggering the import):

provision:show-import -l MINION http url=http://127.0.0.1:8000/req.xml

==== File Handler

Examples:

.Simple

 file:///path/to/my/requisition.xml

.Using the generic handler

 requisition://file?path=/path/to/my/requisition.xml;location=MINION

==== DNS Handler


==== HTTP Handler

Examples:

.Simple

 http://myinventory.server.org/nodes.cgi

.Using the generic handler

 requisition://http?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmyinventory.server.org%2Fnodes.cgi

TIP: When using the generic handler, the URL should be "URL encoded".

==== DNS Handler

The DNS handler requests a _Zone Transfer (AXFR) request_ from a DNS server.
The A records are recorded and used to build an import requisition.
This is handy for organizations that use DNS (possibly coupled with an IP management tool) as the data base of record for nodes in the network.
So, rather than ping sweeping the network or entering the nodes manually into {opennms-product-name} Provisioning UI, nodes can be managed via 1 or more DNS servers.

The format of the URL for this new protocol handler is: dns://<host>[:port]/<zone>[/<foreign-source>/][?expression=<regex>]

DNS Import Examples:

.Simple

 dns://my-dns-server/myzone.com

This URL will import all A records from the host `my-dns-server` on port 53 (default port) from zone "myzone.com" and since the foreign source (a.k.a. the provisioning group) is not specified it will default to the specified zone.

.Using a Regular Expression Filter

 dns://my-dns-server/myzone.com/portland/?expression=^por-.*

This URL will import all nodes from the same server and zone but will only manage the nodes in the zone matching the regular expression `^port-.*` and will and they will be assigned a unique foreign source (provisioning group) for managing these nodes as a subset of nodes from within the specified zone.

If your expression requires URL encoding (for example you need to use a `?` in the expression) it must be properly encoded.

 dns://my-dns-server/myzone.com/portland/?expression=^por[0-9]%3F

.DNS Setup

Currently, the DNS server requires to be setup to allow a zone transfer from the {opennms-product-name} server.
It is recommended that a secondary DNS server is running on {opennms-product-name} and that the {opennms-product-name} server be allowed to request a zone transfer.
A quick way to test if zone transfers are working is:

 dig -t AXFR @<dnsServer> <zone>

.Configuration

The configuration of the Provisoning system has moved from a properties file (`model-importer.properties`) to an XML based configuration container.
The configuration is now extensible to allow the definition of 0 or more import requisitions each with their own cron based schedule for automatic importing from various sources (intended for integration with external URL such as http and this new dns protocol handler.

A default configuration is provided in the {opennms-product-name} `etc/` directory and is called: `provisiond-configuration.xml`.
This default configuration has an example for scheduling an import from a DNS server running on the localhost requesting nodes from the zone, localhost and will be imported once per day at the stroke of midnight.
Not very practical but is a good example.

.Configuration Reload

Like many of the daemon configuration in the 1.7 branch, the configurations are reloadable without having to restart {opennms-product-name}, using the reloadDaemonConfig uei:

 /opt/opennms/bin/send-event.pl
 uei.opennms.org/internal/reloadDaemonConfig --parm 'daemonName Provisiond'

This means that you don't have to restart {opennms-product-name} every time you update the configuration.
