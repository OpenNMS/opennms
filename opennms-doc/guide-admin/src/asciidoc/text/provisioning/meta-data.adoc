=== Meta-Data assigned to Nodes
A requisition can contain arbitrary link:#ga-meta-data[meta-data] for each node, interface and service it contains.
During provisioning, the meta-data is copied to the model and persisted in the database.

While provisioning a requisition, the meta-data from the requisition is transferred to the database and assigned to the nodes, interfaces and services accordingly.

==== User defined contexts
If there is a requirement to add more contexts not managed by {opennms-product-name}, the context name must be prefixed by `X-`.
Any third-party software must take care to choose a context name which is unique enough to not conflict with other software.
