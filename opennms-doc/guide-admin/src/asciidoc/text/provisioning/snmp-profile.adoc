=== SNMP Profiles

SNMP Profiles are prefabricated sets of SNMP configuration which are automatically "fitted" against eligible IP addresses at provisioning time.
Each profile may have a unique label and an optional filter expression.
If the filter expression is present, it will be evaluated to check whether a given IP address or reverse-lookup hostname passes the filter.
A profile with a filter expression will be fitted to a given IP address only if the filter expression evaluates true against that IP address.

SNMP profiles can be added to snmp-config.xml to enable automatic fitting of SNMP interfaces.

.Sample snmp-config.xml with profiles
----
<snmp-config xmlns="http://xmlns.opennms.org/xsd/config/snmp" write-community="private" read-community="public" timeout="800" retry="3">
   <definition version="v1" ttl="6000">
      <specific>127.0.0.1</specific>
   </definition>
   <profiles>
      <profile version="v1" read-community="horizon" timeout="10000">
         <label>profile1</label>
      </profile>
      <profile version="v1" ttl="6000">
         <label>profile2</label>
         <filter>iphostname LIKE '%opennms%'</filter>
      </profile>
      <profile version="v1" read-community="meridian">
         <label>profile3</label>
         <filter>IPADDR IPLIKE 172.1.*.*</filter>
      </profile>
   </profiles>
</snmp-config>
----
In the above config,

1. `profile1` doesn't have a filter expression.
This profile will be tried for every interface.

2. `profile2` has a filter expression that compares `iphostname` (the hostname resulting from a reverse DNS lookup of the IP address being fitted) against a preconfigured value.
This profile's SNMP parameters will be fitted only against IP addresses whose hostname contains the string `opennms`.

3. `profile3` has an IPLIKE expression that matches all interfaces in the range specified in the filter.
This profile's SNMP parameters will be fitted only against IP addresses in the range specified by the `IPLIKE` expression.

NOTE: Profiles will be tried in the order they are configured.
The first match that produces a successful SNMP `GET-REQUEST` on the scalar instance of `sysObjectID` will be saved by `Provisiond` as the SNMP configuratoin definition to use for all future SNMP operations against the fitted IP address.

NOTE: `default` as profile label is reserved for default SNMP config.

.Fit a SNMP profile

The `opennms:snmp-fit` Karaf shell command finds a matching profile for a given IP address and prints out the resulting config.

Matching or "fitting" an SNMP profile should be understood as passing the profile's filter expression _and_ success in getting the scalar `sysObjectID` instance.

$ ssh -p 8101 admin@localhost
...
admin@opennms()> opennms:snmp-fit -l MINION -s 172.1.1.105               <1>
admin@opennms()> opennms:snmp-fit 172.1.1.106 profile1                   <2>
admin@opennms()> opennms:snmp-fit -s -n -f Switches 172.1.1.107 profile2 <3>
----
<1> searches the profiles that fit the IP address `172.1.1.105` at location `Minion` and saves the resulting configuration as a definition for future use.
<2> checks whether the profile with label `profile1` is a fit for IP address `172.1.1.106`, but does not save the resulting configuration if it is a fit.
<3> checks whether the profile labeled `profile2` is a fit for IP address `172.1.1.107`; if so, it saves the resulting configuration and also sends a `newSuspect` event, telling {opennms-product-name} to auto-provision the node at that IP address into the `Switches` requisition.
If it succeeds, it prints out the resulting agent config, but does not save any definition.

.Remove an IP address from definition.

The `opennms:snmp-remove-from-definition` Karaf shell command removes an IP address from the system-wide SNMP configuration definitions.

----
$ ssh -p 8101 admin@localhost
...
admin@opennms()> opennms:snmp-remove-from-definition -l MINION 172.1.0.255
----

This removes IP address `172.1.0.255` at location `MINION` from the system-wide SNMP configuration so that this IP address can be fitted to a new profile.
This command might be useful when an IP address formerly assigned to an SNMPv2c-capable switch is reassigned to an SNMPv3-capable load balancer.

.Using SNMP profiles in Snmp Detector

By default SnmpDetector doesn't use SNMP profiles. Add property `useSnmpProfiles` and set it to `true` in order to use SNMP Profiles.
