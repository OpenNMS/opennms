[[ga-flow-support-introduction]]
=== Introduction

_{opennms-product-name}_ supports receiving, decoding and persisting flow information sent via _Netflow v5_, _Netflow v9_, _IPFIX_ and _sFlow_.
While flows offer a great breadth of information, the current focus of the support in _{opennms-product-name}_ is aimed at:

* Network diagnostic: Being able to view the top protocols and top talkers within the context of a particular network interface.
* Forensic analysis: Persisting the flows for long term storage.

==== How it works

At a high level:

* <<ga-telemetryd, telemetryd>> is used to receive and decode flows on both _{opennms-product-name}_ and _Minion_.
* The _telemetryd_ adapters convert the flows to a canonical flow model and dispatch these to the _flow repository_.
* The _flow repository_ enriches the flows and persists them to Elasticsearch:
** Flows are tagged with an application name via the <<ga-flow-support-classification-engine, Classification Engine>>.
** Metadata related to associated nodes such as ids and categories are also added to the flows.
* The _REST API_ supports generating both summaries and time series data from the flows stored in the _flow repository_.
* _OpenNMS Helm_ is used to visualize the flow data using the _flow datasource_ that interfaces with the  _{opennms-product-name}_ _REST API_.
