The DNS Resolver is used internally by OpenNMS modules and functions to provide lookup functionality as required.

=== Modules that use DNS Resolution
* <<ga-telemetryd, TelemetryD>>


=== Configuring DNS Resolution
In order to customize the DNS servers that are queried, the following commands can be used:
[source]
----
$ ssh -p 8201 admin@localhost
...
admin@minion()> config:edit org.opennms.features.dnsresolver.netty
admin@minion()> property-set nameservers 8.8.8.8,4.2.2.2:53,[::1]:5353
admin@minion()> property-set query-timeout-millis 5000
admin@minion()> config:update
----

If no nameservers are set (or set to an empty string), the servers configured by the system running the JVM will be used.

The resolved host names are cached for their TTL as specified in the returned DNS records.
TTL handling can be customized by setting the `min-ttl-seconds`, `max-ttl-seconds` and `negative-ttl-seconds` properties in the configuration above.

=== Configuring Circuit Breaker
Circuit Breaker functionality exist that helps prevent your DNS infrastructure from being flooded with requests when multiple failures occur. It is enabled by default but can be disabled by setting `breaker-enabled` to `false`

Additional parameters can be modified to tune the functionality of the circuit breaker:
[source]
----
$ ssh -p 8201 admin@localhost
...
admin@minion()> config:edit org.opennms.features.dnsresolver.netty
admin@minion()> property-set breaker-enabled true
admin@minion()> property-set breaker-failure-rate-threshold 80
admin@minion()> property-set breaker-wait-duration-in-open-state 15
admin@minion()> property-set breaker-ring-buffer-size-in-half-open-state 10
admin@minion()> property-set breaker-ring-buffer-size-in-closed-state 100
admin@minion()> config:update
----

NOTE: If the circuit breaker is disabled, the lookup statistics `lookupsSuccessful` and `lookupsFailed` are no longer tracked.
