=== SNMP Interface Poller

_{opennms-product-name}_ can monitor the status of a SNMP interface that is not directly monitored by a <<ga-service-assurance, Service Assurance>> monitor.

The SNMP Interface Poller is a separate service that uses a node interface, typically a management interface, to get administration and operational status for other interfaces present on the device.
On a configurable time interval a SNMP GET request is made for two specific objects in an `ifEntry` of the `ifTable` defined in the `IF-MIB`:

```
ifAdminStatus OBJECT-TYPE
              SYNTAX  INTEGER {
                          up(1),       -- ready to pass packets
                          down(2),
                          testing(3)   -- in some test mode
                      }
              ACCESS  read-write
              STATUS  current
              DESCRIPTION
                      "The desired state of the interface.  The testing(3) state
                      indicates that no operational packets can be passed. When a
                      managed system initializes, all interfaces start with
                      ifAdminStatus in the down(2) state.  As a result of either
                      explicit management action or per configuration information
                      retained by the managed system, ifAdminStatus is then
                      changed to either the up(1) or testing(3) states (or remains
                      in the down(2) state)."
              ::= { ifEntry 7 }

ifOperStatus OBJECT-TYPE
              SYNTAX  INTEGER {
                          up(1),        -- ready to pass packets
                          down(2),
                          testing(3),   -- in some test mode
                          unknown(4),   -- status can not be determined
                                        -- for some reason.
                          dormant(5),
                          notPresent(6),    -- some component is missing
                          lowerLayerDown(7) -- down due to state of
                                            -- lower-layer interface(s)
                      }
              ACCESS  read-only
              STATUS  current
              DESCRIPTION
                      "The current operational state of the interface.  The
                      testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can
                      be passed.  If ifAdminStatus is down(2) then ifOperStatus
                      should be down(2).  If ifAdminStatus is changed to up(1)
                      then ifOperStatus should change to up(1) if the interface is
                      ready to transmit and receive network traffic; it should
                      change to dormant(5) if the interface is waiting for
                      external actions (such as a serial line waiting for an
                      incoming connection); it should remain in the down(2) state
                      if and only if there is a fault that prevents it from going
                      to the up(1) state; it should remain in the notPresent(6)
                      state if the interface has missing (typically, hardware)
                      components."
              ::= { ifEntry 8 }
```

After retrieving these values the service will:

* Update the values of `ifAdminStatus` and `ifOperStatus` of the polled interfaces in the database.
This column is normally only updated when an import of a <<ga-provisioning, Provisiond>> requisition takes place.
* Send events when the state of a polled interface changes state. The UEIs of these events are:
** `uei.opennms.org/nodes/snmp/interfaceAdminDown`
** `uei.opennms.org/nodes/snmp/interfaceAdminUp`
** `uei.opennms.org/nodes/snmp/interfaceOperDown`
** `uei.opennms.org/nodes/snmp/interfaceOperUp`
** `uei.opennms.org/nodes/snmp/interfaceOperTesting`
** `uei.opennms.org/nodes/snmp/interfaceOperUnknown`
** `uei.opennms.org/nodes/snmp/interfaceOperDormant`
** `uei.opennms.org/nodes/snmp/interfaceOperNotPresent`
** `uei.opennms.org/nodes/snmp/interfaceOperLowerLayerDown`

The appropriate event will be sent whenever:

* a polled interface's `ifAdminStatus` is up and `ifOperStatus` is in a down state at startup
* `ifAdminStatus` is in an up state and `ifOperStatus` transitions to a down state from a not down state
* `ifAdminStatus` is in an up state and `ifOperStatus` transitions to an up state from a not up state
* `ifAdminStatus` transitions to a down state from a not down state
* `ifAdminStatus` transitions to an up state from a not up state

NOTE: It is possible to configure the service to treat additional values of `ifOperStatus` as logically up or down.
In the event that this configuration option is used and `ifOperStatus` transitions to a state configured as a down value that is not literally `down(2)`, both the `uei.opennms.org/nodes/snmp/interfaceOperDown` event and an event for the more specific state is sent.

=== Enabling the Service

By default the SNMP Interface Poller daemon is not enabled.
To enable it, simply change the value of the `enabled` attribute of the `service` element that contains a `name` element with the following text: `OpenNMS:Name=SnmpPoller`.

```
<service enabled="true">
   <name>OpenNMS:Name=SnmpPoller</name>
   <class-name>org.opennms.netmgt.snmpinterfacepoller.jmx.SnmpPollerd</class-name>
   <invoke at="start" pass="0" method="init"/>
   <invoke at="start" pass="1" method="start"/>
   <invoke at="status" pass="0" method="status"/>
   <invoke at="stop" pass="0" method="stop"/>
</service>
```

A restart of _{opennms-product-name}_ is required.

### Configuring the Service

The configuration file is `$ONMS_HOME/etc/snmp-interface-poller-configuration.xml`.
The default version of this file follows:

```
<snmp-interface-poller-configuration xmlns="http://xmlns.opennms.org/xsd/config/snmpinterfacepoller" threads="30" service="SNMP"  up-values="1" down-values="2">
   <node-outage>
      <critical-service name="ICMP"/>
      <critical-service name="SNMP"/>
   </node-outage>
   <package name="example1">
      <filter>IPADDR != '0.0.0.0'</filter>
      <include-range begin="1.1.1.1" end="1.1.1.1"/>
      <include-range begin="::1" end="::1"/>
      <interface criteria="snmpiftype = 6" name="Ethernet" interval="300000" user-defined="false" status="on"/>
   </package>
   <!--  package name="overwritesnmpvalues">
      <filter>IPADDR != '0.0.0.0'</filter>
       <include-range begin="1.1.1.1" end="254.254.254.254" />
       <interface name="Ethernet" criteria="snmpiftype = 6" interval="300000" user-defined="false" status="on" port="161" timeout="1000" retry="1" max-vars-per-pdu="10" />
   </package-->
</snmp-interface-poller-configuration>
```

Explanation of the configuration options available:

snmp-interface-poller-configuration::
Top-level element for the snmp-interface-poller-configuration.xml configuration file.
Several global configuration attributes are available:
* _interval_: The default polling interval in milliseconds.
* _threads_: The maximum number of threads used for snmp polling.
* _service_: The SNMP service string; almost always "SNMP".
* _useCriteriaFilters_: Flag which indicates if interfaces that do not match the criteria attribute of an interface element in an otherwise matching package should be polled with default settings or not.
When "false" such an interface will be polled with default settings; when "true" that interface will not be polled.
* _up-values_: A comma separated list of valid integer values (1-7) to treat as equivalent to `up(1)` when sending status change events for an interface.
Defaults to "1".
* _down-values_: A comma separated list of valid integer values (1-7) to treat as equivalent to `down(2)` when sending status change events for an interface.
Defaults to "2".

node-outage::
Polling will not be attempted if any of the critical service(s) contained in this element are unavailable on a node interface.

critical-service::
The `name` attribute of this element indicates the name of a service that, when unavailable, will prevent the attempted polling of SNMP interfaces on a node interface.

package::
Similar to <<ga-service-assurance, Service Assurance>> and <<ga-performance-mgmt, Performance Management>> packages, this service uses package elements to allow different settings to be used for different types of devices.
Has a single attribute, `name`, which is mandatory.

filter::
Mandatory.
Behaves just like `filter` elements in pollerd <<ga-pollerd-packages, packages>>.

specific:: Behaves just like `specific` elements in pollerd <<ga-pollerd-packages, packages>>.

include-range:: Behaves just like `include-range` elements in pollerd <<ga-pollerd-packages, packages>>.

exclude-range:: Behaves just like `exclude-range` elements in pollerd <<ga-pollerd-packages, packages>>.

include-url:: Behaves just like `include-url` in other pollerd <<ga-pollerd-packages, packages>>.

NOTE: The `filter`, `specific`, `include-range`, `exclude-range`, and `include-url` elements apply to the node and interface on which the SNMP interface data resides, not the SNMP interfaces themselves.

interface:: Controls how, when, and (sometimes) which specific kinds of SNMP interfaces will be polled for status from management interfaces that match the package rules. Attributes include:
* _name_: A name for this interface element.
It is generally advisable to make the name representative of the criteria filter of the interface. Required.
* _criteria_: Criteria added to the SQL query performed on the SNMP interfaces available for polling on an interface node.
Can have more than one.
Allows you to specify different settings for different types of interfaces.
As noted above, if `useCriteriaFilters` is `true` on the top level element, any interface that does not match the criteria filter on one of the interface elements will not be polled.
* _interval_: The polling interval for interfaces matching this element's criteria in milliseconds.
Overrides the global setting in the top level element for interfaces that match this element's criteria filter.
* _user-defined_: An unused boolean value that is reserved for use in the UI, should one ever exist for this service.
Defaults to `false`.
* _status_: When `off` polling will not be performed for SNMP interfaces that meet the criteria filter of this element.
Defaults to `on`.
* _port_: If set, overrides UDP port 161 as the port where SNMP GET/GETNEXT/GETBULK requests are sent.
Valid values are between 1 and 65535.
* _retry_: Number of retry attempts made when attempting to retrieve `ifAdminStatus` and `ifOperStatus` values from the management interface for SNMP interfaces that match this element's criteria filter.
* _timeout_: Timeout in milliseconds to wait for a response to SNMP GET/GETNEXT/GETBULK requests sent to the node interface.
* _max-vars-per-pdu_: Number of variables to send per SNMP request.
Default is "10".
* _up-values_: Values of `ifAdminStatus` and `ifOperStatus` to treat as up values.
Expects a comma separated list of integer values between 1 and 7.
Example: "1,5".
Defaults to "1".
* _down-values_: Values of `ifAdminStatus` and `ifOperStatus` to treat as down values.
Expects a comma separated list of integer values between 1 and 7.
Example: "2,3,4,6,7".
Defaults to "2".

### Using the Service

Besides enabling the service and configuring packages and interfaces to match your use case, a policy that enables polling must be added to the foreign source definition of the import requisitions of the devices on which you'd like to use this feature.

Use the `ENABLE_POLLING` and `DISABLE_POLLING` actions of the "Matching SNMP Interface Policy" to manage which SNMP interfaces are polled by this service along with the appropriate `matchBehavior` and parameters for your use case.

As an example, you could create a policy named _pollVoIPDialPeers_ that marks interfaces with `ifType 104` to be polled.
Set the `action` to `ENABLE_POLLING` and `matchBehavior` to `ALL_PARAMETERS`.
Add parameter `ifType` with `104` for the value.
Once you synchronize the requisition, SNMP interface polling will begin for all SNMP interfaces with `ifType 104` found on node interfaces matching the filter of a package in the SNMP interface poller config file.

As explained in the prior sections, exactly how and when the polling is performed is controlled by the settings on the `interface` element the SNMP interface matches in that package.
If a SNMP interface does not match the criteria of any `interface` element in a package, default settings are used, unless `useCriteriaFilters` is set to true in the top level element, in which case no polling is performed.
