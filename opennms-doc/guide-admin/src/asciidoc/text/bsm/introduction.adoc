While _{opennms-product-name}_ detects issues in your network by device, interface or service, the _Business Service Monitoring (BSM)_ takes it one step further.
The _BSM_ components allows you to monitor and model high level _Business Services (BS)_ and helps quickly identify the most critical problems affecting these.
With the _BSM_ feature it is possible to model a high level _BS_ context around the technical _Service Monitors_ provided in _{opennms-product-name}_.
To indicate which _BS_ is affected by events at the technical _Service Monitors_ level, a BS _Operational Status_ is calculated.

As an example, let's assume a company runs an online store.
Customers enter through a login system, select items, place them in the shopping cart and checkout using a payment system.
The whole service is provided by a few web servers and access data from databases.
To monitor the status of the databases, a _SQL_ service monitor on each database server is configured.
For testing the web servers a _HTTP_ service monitor is used for each of them.
Covering the overall functionality a _Page Sequence Monitor (PSM)_ is used to test the login, shop and payment workflow through the provided web portal.
A possible representation of the whole system hierarchy is shown in figure <<ga-bsm-example-web-shop,Example scenario for a web shop>>.

To be able to model this scenarios the _BSM_ functions can be used.
The _Business Service Monitoring (BSM)_ feature includes the following components:

* _Business Service Monitoring Daemon (BSMD)_: Maintains and drives the state of all _BS_
* _Business Service Editor_: Web application which allows you to create, update or delete _BS_
* _Topology View for Business Services_: Visual representation of the _Business Service Hierarchy_ as a component of the _Topology User Interface_.
* _BSM ReST API_: ReST based API to create, read, update or delete _BS_
