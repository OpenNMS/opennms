=== Reduce Functions

A _Reduce Function_ is used to aggregate the _Operational Status_ for the _BS_.
The _Alarm Severity_ from the _Edges_ are used as input for the _Reduce Function_.
For this operation the following _Reduce Functions_ are available:

|===
| Name                      | Description
| `Highest Severity`        | Uses the value of the highest severity, _Weight_ is ignored.
| `Threshold`               | Uses the highest severity found more often than the given threshold, e.g. 0.26 can also be seen as 26%, which means at least 2 of 4 _Alarms_ need to be raised to change the _BS_.
| `Highest Severity Above`  | Uses the highest severity greater than the given threshold severity.
|===

The following table shows the status calculation with _Edges_ assigned to an _IP Service_.
The _IP-Service_ is driven by the monitoring of the _ICMP_ service for three Web Server.
In the table below you find a configuration where _Web Server 3_ is weighted 3 times higher than the other and a threshold of 0.33 (33%) is configured.

|===

The _Operational Status Severity_ is evaluated from left to right, the first value higher then the configured _Threshold_ is used.
In this case the _Operational Status_ is set to _Warning_ because the first threshold which exceeds _33%_ is _Warning_ with _80%_.
