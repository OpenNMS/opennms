=== Reduce Functions

A _Reduce Function_ is used to aggregate the _Operational Status_ for the _BS_.
The _Alarm Severity_ from the _Edges_ are used as input for the _Reduce Function_.
For this operation the following _Reduce Functions_ are available:

|===
| Name                      | Description
| `Highest Severity`        | Uses the value of the highest severity, _Weight_ is ignored.
| `Threshold`               | Uses the highest severity found more often than the given threshold, e.g. 0.26 can also be seen as 26%, which means at least 2 of 4 _Alarms_ need to be raised to change the _BS_.
| `Highest Severity Above`  | Uses the highest severity greater than the given threshold severity.
| `Exponential Propagation` | This reduce function computes the sum of the given child severities based on a base number. For this computation the severities are mapped to
                              numbers:

                              asciimath:[WARNING=0, MINOR=1, MAJOR=2, CRITICAL=3]

                              All other severities are ignored.

                              For the aggregation the following formula will be used to compute the resulting Business Service severity from its _n_ child entities based on the base number _b_:

                              asciimath:[severity = \|__log_{b}( sum_(i=1)^n b^(ch\ildSeverity_{i}) )__\|]

                              In summary the base value defines how many items of a severity _x_ will result in a severity _x+1_.
                              Results lower as _0_ are treated as _NORMAL_ and results higher than _3_ are treated as _CRITICAL_.
                              If all input values are of severity _INDETERMINATE_, the result is _INDETERMINATE_.

                              For example if the Business Service depends on four child entities with the severities _WARNING_, _WARNING_, _NORMAL_ and _NORMAL_ and the base defined by the number 2 the following computation will be made:

                              asciimath:[severity = \|__log_{2}( 2^{0} + 2^{0} + 0 + 0 )__\| = \|__log_{2}( 1 + 1 + 0 + 0)__\| = \|__log_{2}( 2 )__\| = \|__1__\| = 1]

                              which corresponds to the severity _MINOR_. The same computation with the base value of 3 results in:

                              asciimath:[severity = \|__log_{3}( 3^{0} + 3^{0} + 0 + 0 )__\| = \|__log_{3}( 1 + 1 + 0 + 0)__\| = \|__log_{3}( 2 )__\| = \|__0.63__\| = 0]

                              which means _WARNING_.

The following table shows the status calculation with _Edges_ assigned to an _IP Service_.
The _IP-Service_ is driven by the monitoring of the _ICMP_ service for three Web Server.
In the table below you find a configuration where _Web Server 3_ is weighted 3 times higher than the other and a threshold of 0.33 (33%) is configured.

The _Operational Status Severity_ is evaluated from left to right, the first value higher then the configured _Threshold_ is used.
In this case the _Operational Status_ is set to _Warning_ because the first threshold which exceeds _33%_ is _Warning_ with _80%_.
