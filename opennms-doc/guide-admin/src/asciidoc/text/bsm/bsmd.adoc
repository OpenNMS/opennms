=== Business Service Daemon

The calculation of the _Operational Status_ of the _BS_ is driven by the _Business Service Monitoring Daemon_ (bsmd).
The daemon is responsible for tracking the operational status of all _BS_ and for sending events in case of operational status changes.
Every time the configuration of a _Business Service_ is changed a reload of the daemon's configuration is required.
This includes changes like the name of the _Business Service_ or its attributes as well as changes regarding the _Reduction Keys_, contained _Business Services_ or _IP Services_.
The _bsmd_ configuration can be reloaded with the following mechanisms:

* Click the _Reload Daemon_ button in the _Business Service Editor_
* Send the _reloadDaemonConfig_ event using `send-event.pl` or use the WebUI in _Manually Send an Event_ with parameter `daemonName bsmd`
* Use the ReST API to perform a `POST` request to `/opennms/api/v2/business-services/daemon/reload`

If the reload of the configuration is done an event of type `uei.opennms.org/internal/reloadDaemonConfigSuccessful` is fired.
