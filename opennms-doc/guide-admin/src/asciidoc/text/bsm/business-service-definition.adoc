=== Business Service Definition

The status of _Service Monitors_ and any kind of _Alarm_ can be used to drive the _Operational Status_ of a _BS_.
A _BS_ is defined with the following components:

* _Business Service Name_: A unique name used to identify the _BS_
* _Edges_: A set of elements on which this _BS_ relies which can include other _BS_, or _Reduction Keys_.
* _Reduce Function_: Function used to aggregate the _Operational Status_ from all the _Edges_.
   Specific functions may take additional parameters.
* _Attributes_: Optional key/value pairs that can be used to tag or enrich the _Busines Service_ with additional information.

Each _Business Service_ can contain a list of optional key/value attributes.
These can be used to identify or tag the _BS_, and may be reference in other workflows.
These attributes do not affect the dependencies or the status calculation of the _BS_.

TIP: Attributes can be used to filter _BS_ in _Ops Board_ dashlets.

The _Business Service Editor_ is used to manage and model the _Business Services_ and their hierarchy.
It is required to have administrative permissions and is available in _"Login Name -> Configure OpenNMS -> Manage Business Services"_ in the _Service Monitoring_ section.
