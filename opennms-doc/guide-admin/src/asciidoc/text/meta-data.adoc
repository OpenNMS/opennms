{opennms-product-name} supports the assignment of arbitrary meta-data to nodes, interfaces and services.

The meta-data is a simple triple of strings containing a context, a key and the associated value.
There can be an arbitrary number of meta-data elements assigned to each node, each interface and each service.
The only restriction is, that the tuple of context and key must be unique in the element to which they are associated.

The meta-data is associated to nodes, interfaces and services during link:#ga-provisioning-meta-data[provisioning].

To view the meta-data currently assigned to nodes, interfaces and services, there according details page can be used.
These pages show the meta-data as it is currently assigned in the database.

The meta-data can be used to dynamically configure service monitoring, performance data collection, and service detection.
They all use a link:#ga-meta-data-dls[simple DSL] which allows to access the meta-data associated to the elements they are working on.

=== The Meta-Data-DSL
The meta-data DSL allow interpolation of meta-data into a parameter.
The syntax allows the usage of patterns like `${context:key|context_fallback:key_fallback|...|default}` in an expression.

Each expressions can contain multiple references to meta-data which will be replaced with the according value during evaluation.
Placeholders starts with `${` and ends with `}` containing a reference to a context-key-pair optionally allowing to define multiple fallback context-key-pairs and and optional trailing default value.
Context and key are separated by a `:`.

`${requisition:username}`::
Will resolve to the `username` as defined in the requisitioning UI or an empty value, if there is no such username defined.

An placeholder can contain an optional default value which is separated by a `|`.

`${requisition:username|admin}`::
Will resolve to the `username` as defined in the requisitioning UI or to the value `admin`, if there is no such username defined.

There can be zero or more fallback context-key-pairs in an placeholder which will follow the primary context-key-pair.
Each fallback context-key-pair is separated by a `|`.

`${requisition:username|requisition:account|admin}`::
Will resolve to the `username` as defined in the requisitioning UI.
If there is no such username defined the fallback `account` will be used.
If both of them do not exist, the fallback value `admin` will be used.

To resolve the value associated with context-key-pair, the DSL uses scopes which will determine the resolution order.
The last scope will be queried first and if a scope does not contain the queried context-key-tuple, the next one will be queried.
Which scopes are available depends on the environment for which a expression is evaluated and is documented in the according places.
Some environments also provide additional scopes which are not backed by the persisted meta-data but provide additional meta-data related to the current evaluation.

==== Testing an expression
To test an expression, there is a karaf shell command which interpolates a string containing a pattern to the final result:
