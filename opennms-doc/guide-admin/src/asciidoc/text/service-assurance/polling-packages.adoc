=== Poller Packages

To define more complex monitoring configuration it is possible to group _Service_ configurations into _Polling Packages_.
They allow to assign to _Nodes_ different _Service Configurations_.
To assign a _Polling Package_ to nodes the link:http://www.opennms.org/wiki/Filters[Rules/Filters] syntax can be used.
Each _Polling Package_ can have its own <<ga-service-assurance-downtime-model, Downtime Model>> configuration.

Multiple packages can be configured, and an interface can exist in more than one package.
This gives great flexibility to how the service levels will be determined for a given device.

.Polling package assigned to Nodes with Rules and Filters
[source, xml]
----
<package name="example1"><1>
  <filter>IPADDR != '0.0.0.0'</filter><2>
  <include-range begin="1.1.1.1" end="254.254.254.254" /><3>
  <include-range begin="::1" end="ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff" /><3>
----
<1> Unique name of the polling package.
<2> Filter can be based on IP address, categories or asset attributes of _Nodes_ based on link:http://www.opennms.org/wiki/Filters[Rules/Filters].
    The filter is evaluated first and is *required*.
    This package is used for all _IP Interfaces_ which don't have 0.0.0.0 as an assigned _IP address_ and is *required*.
<3> Allow to specify if the configuration of _Services_ is applied on a range of _IP Interfaces_ (IPv4 or IPv6).

Instead of the `include-range` it is possible to add one or more specific _IP-Interfaces_ with:

.Defining a specific _IP Interfaces_
[source, xml]
----
<specific>192.168.1.59</specific>
----

It is also possible to exclude _IP Interfaces_ with:

.Exclude IP Interfaces

----
<exclude-range begin="192.168.0.100" end="192.168.0.104"/>
----

[[ga-pollerd-packages-response-time-config]]
==== Response Time Configuration

The definition of _Polling Packages_ allows to configure similar services with different polling intervals.
All the response time measurements are persisted in _RRD Files_ and require a definition.
Each _Polling Package_ contains a _RRD_ definition

<package name="example1">
  <filter>IPADDR != '0.0.0.0'</filter>
  <include-range begin="1.1.1.1" end="254.254.254.254" />
  <include-range begin="::1" end="ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff" />

    <rra>RRA:MAX:0.5:288:366</rra><5>
    <rra>RRA:MIN:0.5:288:366</rra><6>
</rrd>
----
<1> Polling interval for all services in this _Polling Package_ is reflected in the step of size 300 seconds.
    All services in this package have to polled in 5 min interval, otherwise response time measurements are not correct persisted.
<2> 1 step size is persisted 2016 times: 1 * 5 min * 2016 = 7 d, 5 min accuracy for 7 d.
<3> 12 steps average persisted 1488 times: 12 * 5 min * 1488 = 62 d, aggregated to 60 min for 62 d.
<4> 288 steps average persisted 366 times: 288 * 5 min * 366 = 366 d, aggregated to 24 h for 366 d.
<5> 288 steps maximum from 24 h persisted for 366 d.
<6> 288 steps minimum from 24 h persisted for 366 d.

WARNING: The _RRD_ configuration and the service polling interval has to be aligned.
         In other cases the persisted response time data is not correct displayed in the response time graph.

IMPORTANT: If the polling interval is changed afterwards, existing _RRD_ files needs to be recreated with the new definitions.

[[ga-pollerd-packages-overlapping-service]]
==== Overlapping Services

With the possibility of specifying multiple _Polling Packages_ it is possible to use the same _Service_ like _ICMP_ multiple times.
The order how _Polling Packages_ in the `poller-configuration.xml` are defined is important when _IP Interfaces_ match multiple _Polling Packages_ with the same _Service_ configuration.

The following example shows which configuration is applied for a specific service:

----
<1> Polling interval in the packages are 300 seconds and 30 seconds
<2> Different polling interval for the service _ICMP_
<3> Different retry settings for the service _ICMP_
<4> Different timeout settings for the service _ICMP_

The last _Polling Package_ on the service will be applied.
This can be used to define a less specific catch all filter for a default configuration.
A more specific _Polling Package_ can be used to overwrite the default setting.
In the example above all _IP Interfaces_ in _192.168.1/24_ or _2600:/64_ will be monitored with ICMP with different polling, retry and timeout settings.

Which _Polling Packages_ are applied to the _IP Interface_ and _Service_ can be found in the _Web User Interface_.
The _IP Interface_ and _Service_ page show which _Polling Package_ and _Service_ configuration is applied for this specific service.

[[ga-pollerd-packages-patterns]]
==== Service Patterns

Usually, the _Poller_ used to monitor a _Service_ is found by the matching the pollers name with the service name.
In addition, a matching poller can be found if an additional element `pattern` is specified for the poller.
If so, the poller is used for all services matching the _RegEx_ pattern, too.

The _RegEx_ pattern allows to specify named capture groups.
There can be multiple capture groups inside of a pattern, but each must have a unique name.
Please note, that the _RegEx_ must be escaped or be wrapped in a CDATA-Tag inside the configuration XML to make it a valid property.

If a poller is matched using its pattern, the parts of the service name which matches the capture groups of the pattern are available as parameters to the link:#ga-pollerd-configuration-meta-data[Meta-Data-DSL] using the context `pattern` and the capture group name as key.

Examples:

`<pattern><![CDATA[^HTTP-(?<vhost>.*)$]]></pattern>`::
Matches all services which names starts with `HTTP-` followed by a host name.
If the services is called `HTTP-www.example.com`, the Meta-DSL expression `${pattern:vhost}` will resolved to `www.example.com`.

`<pattern><![CDATA[^HTTP-(?<vhost>.*?):(?<port>[0-9]+)$]]></pattern>"`::
Matches all services which names starts with `HTTP-` followed by a hostname and a port.
There will be two variables (`${pattern:vhost}` and `${pattern:port}`) which can be used in the poller parameters.

The service pattern mechanism can be used to whenever there are multiple instances of a service on the same interface.
By specifying a distinct service name to each instance, the services is identifiable, but there is no need to add a poller definition per service.
Common use-cases for such services are HTTP Virtual Hosts, where multiple web applications run on the same web-server or BGP session monitoring where each router has multiple neighbours.
