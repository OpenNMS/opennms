=== Critical Service

Monitoring services on an _IP network_ can be resource expensive, especially in cases where many of these services are not available.
When a service is offline, or unreachable, the monitoring system spends most of it's time waiting for retries and timeouts.

In order to improve efficiency, _{opennms-product-title}_ deems all services on a interface to be _Down_ if the critical service is _Down_.
By default _{opennms-product-title}_ uses _ICMP_ as the critical service.

The following image shows, how a _Critical Services_ is used to generate these events.

* (1) Critical services are all _Up_ on the _Node_ and just a _nodeLostService_ is sent.
* (2) Critical service of one of many _IP interface_ is _Down_ and _interfaceDown_ is sent.
      All other services are not tested and no events are sent, the services are assumed as unreachable.
* (3) All Critical services on the _Node_ are _Down_ and just a _nodeDown_ is sent.
      All other services on the other _IP Interfaces_ are not tested and no events are sent, these services are assumed as unreachable.

The _Critical Service_ is used to correlate outages from _Services_ to a _nodeDown_ or _interfaceDown_ event.
It is a global configuration of _Pollerd_ defined in `poller-configuration.xml`.
The _{opennms-product-title}_ default configuration enables this behavior.

<poller-configuration threads="30"
                      pathOutageEnabled="false"
                      serviceUnresponsiveEnabled="false">

    <critical-service name="ICMP" /> <3>
  </node-outage>
----
<1> Enable _Node Outage_ correlation based on a _Critical Service_
<2> Optional: In case of nodes without a _Critical Service_ this option controls the behavior.
    If set to `true` then all services will be polled.
    If set to `false` then the first service in the package that exists on the node will be polled until service is restored, and then polling will resume for all services.
<3> Define _Critical Service_ for _Node Outage_ correlation
