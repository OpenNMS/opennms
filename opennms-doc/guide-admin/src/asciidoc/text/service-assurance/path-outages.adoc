=== Path Outages

An outage of a central network component can cause a lot of node outages.
_Path Outages_ can be used to suppress _Notifications_ based on how _Nodes_ depend on each other in the network which are defined in a _Critical Path_.
The _Critical Path_ needs to be configured from the network perspective of the monitoring system.
By default the _Path Outage_ feature is disabled and has to be enabled in the `poller-configuration.xml`.

The following image shows an example network topology.

.Path Outage example
image::service-assurance/02_path-outage.png[width=600]

From the perspective of the monitoring system, a Router named _default-gw-01_ is on the _Critical Path_ to reach two networks.
If Router _default-gw-01_ is down, it is not possible to reach any node in the two networks behind and they will be all unreachable as well.
In this case an administrator would like to have just one notification for _default-gw-01_ and not for all the other _Nodes_ behind.
Building this configuration in _{opennms-product-name}_ requires the following information:

* _Parent Foreign Source_: The _Foreign Source_ where the parent node is defined.
* _Parent Foreign ID_: The _Foreign ID_ of the parent _Node_ where this node depends on.
* The _IP Interface_ selected as _Primary_ is used as _Critical IP_

In this example we have created all _Nodes_ in a _Provisioning Requisition_ named `Network-ACME` and we use as the _Foreign ID_ the same as the _Node Label_.

In the Web UI go to _Admin -> Configure OpenNMS -> Manage Provisioning Requisitions -> Edit the Requisition -> Edit the Node -> Path Outage_ to configure the network path by setting the _Parent Foreign Source_, _Parent Foreign ID_ and _Provisioned Node_.

|===
| Parent Foreign Source | Parent Foreign ID | Provisioned Node
| _not defined_         | _not defined_     | `default-gw-01`
| `Network-ACME`        | `default-gw-01`   | `node-01`
| `Network-ACME`        | `default-gw-01`   | `node-02`
| `Network-ACME`        | `default-gw-01`   | `default-gw02`
| `Network-ACME`        | `default-gw-02`   | `node-03`
| `Network-ACME`        | `default-gw-02`   | `node-04`

IMPORTANT: The _IP Interface_ which is set to _Primary_ is selected as the _Critical IP_.
           In this example it is important the _IP interface_ on _default-gw-01_ in the network _192.168.1.0/24_ is set as _Primary_ interface.
           The IP interface in the network _172.23.42.0/24_ on _default-gw-02_ is set as _Primary_ interface.
