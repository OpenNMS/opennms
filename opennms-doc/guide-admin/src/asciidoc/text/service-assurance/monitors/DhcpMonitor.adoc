==== DhcpMonitor

This monitor is used to monitor the availability and functionality of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol[DHCP servers].
This monitor has two parts, the first one is the monitor class _DhcpMonitor_ executed by _Pollerd_ and the second part is a background daemon _Dhcpd_ running inside the {opennms-product-name} JVM and listening for DHCP responses.
A DHCP server is tested by sending a _DISCOVER_ message.
If the DHCP server responds with an _OFFER_ the service is marked as up.
The _Dhcpd_ background daemon is disabled by default and has to be activated in `service-configuration.xml` in {opennms-product-name} by setting `service enabled="true"`.
The behavior for testing the DHCP server can be modified in the `dhcp-configuration.xml` configuration file.

IMPORTANT: It is required to install the `{opennms-package-base-name}-plugin-protocol-dhcp` before you can use this feature.

.Installing the {opennms-package-base-name}-plugin-protocol-dhcp package
----
{apt-get,yum} install {opennms-package-base-name}-plugin-protocol-dhcp
----

If you try to start _{opennms-product-name}_ without the _{opennms-package-base-name}-plugin-protocol-dhcp_ you will see the following error message in `output.log`:

----
An error occurred while attempting to start the "OpenNMS:Name=Dhcpd" service (class org.opennms.netmgt.dhcpd.jmx.Dhcpd).  Shutting down and exiting.
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.opennms.netmgt.dhcpd.jmx.Dhcpd
----

CAUTION: Make sure no DHCP client is running on the _{opennms-product-name}_ server and using port UDP/68.
         If UDP/68 is already in use, you will find an error message in the manager.log.
         You can test if a process is listening on udp/68 with `sudo ss -lnpu sport = :68`.

===== _Dhcpd_ configuration

._Dhcpd_ parameters in `dhcp-configuration.xml`.
[options="autowidth"]
|===
| Parameter          | Description                                                                       | Required           | Default value
| `port`             | Defines the port your dhcp server is using                                        | required           | `5818`
| `macAddress`       | The MAC address which {opennms-product-name} uses for a dhcp request                             | required           | `00:06:0D:BE:9C:B2`
| `myIpAddress`      | This parameter will usually be set to the IP address of the {opennms-product-name} server,
                       which puts the DHCP poller in `relay` mode as opposed to `broadcast` mode.
                       In `relay` mode, the DHCP server being polled will unicast its responses directly
                       back to the IP address specified by `myIpAddress` rather than broadcasting its
                       responses. This allows DHCP servers to be polled even though they are not on the
                       same subnet as the {opennms-product-name} server, and without the aid of an external relay.
                       _Usage:_ `myIpAddress="10.11.12.13"` or `myIpAddress="broadcast"`                 | required           | `broadcast`
| `extendedMode`     | When extendedMode is false, the DHCP poller will send a DISCOVER and expect an
                       OFFER in return. When extendedMode is true, the DHCP poller will first send a
                       DISCOVER. If no valid response is received it will send an INFORM. If no valid
                       response is received it will then send a REQUEST. OFFER, ACK, and NAK are all
                       considered valid responses in extendedMode.
                       _Usage:_ `extendedMode="true"` or `extendedMode="false"`                          | required           | `false`
| `requestIpAddress` | This parameter only applies to REQUEST queries sent to the DHCP server when
                       extendedMode is true. If an IP address is specified, that IP address will be
                       requested in the query. If `targetHost` is specified, the DHCP server's own IP
                       address will be requested. Since a well-managed server will probably not respond
                       to a request for its own IP, this parameter can also be set to `targetSubnet`.
                       This is similar to `targetHost` except the DHCP server's IP address is
                       incremented or decremented by 1 to obtain an ip address that is on the same
                       subnet.
                       (The resulting address will not be on the same subnet if the DHCP server's
                       subnet is a /32 or /31. Otherwise, the algorithm used should be reliable.)
                       _Usage:_ `requestIpAddress="10.77.88.99"` or `requestIpAddress="targetHost"`
                       or `requestIpAddress="targetSubnet"`                                              | required           | `false`

===== Example testing DHCP server in the same subnet

Example configuration how to configure the monitor in the `poller-configuration.xml`.
The monitor will try to send in maximum 3 _DISCOVER_ messages and waits 3 seconds for the DHCP server _OFFER_ message.

.Step 1: Configure a DHCP service in `poller-configuration.xml`
[source, xml]
----
<service name="DHCP" interval="300000" user-defined="false" status="on">
 <parameter key="retry" value="2" />
 <parameter key="timeout" value="3000" />
 <parameter key="rrd-repository" value="/opt/opennms/share/rrd/response" />
 <parameter key="rrd-base-name" value="dhcp" />
 <parameter key="ds-name" value="dhcp" />
</service>

<monitor service="DHCP" class-name="org.opennms.protocols.dhcp.monitor.DhcpMonitor"/>
----

.Step 2: Enable the {opennms-product-name} _Dhcpd_ daemon in `service-configuration.xml`
[source, xml]
----
<service enabled="true">
  <name>OpenNMS:Name=Dhcpd</name>
  <class-name>org.opennms.netmgt.dhcpd.jmx.Dhcpd</class-name>
  <invoke method="start" pass="1" at="start"/>
  <invoke method="status" pass="0" at="status"/>
  <invoke method="stop" pass="0" at="stop"/>
</service>
----

.Step 3: Configure _Dhcpd_ to test a DHCP server in the same subnet as the {opennms-product-name} server.
[source, xml]
----
<DhcpdConfiguration
       port="5818"
       macAddress="00:06:0D:BE:9C:B2"
       myIpAddress="broadcast
       extendedMode="false"
       requestIpAddress="127.0.0.1">
</DhcpdConfiguration>
----

===== Example testing DHCP server in a different subnet in extended mode

You can use the same monitor in `poller-configuration.xml` as in the example above.

.Configure _Dhcpd_ to test DHCP server in a different subnet. The OFFER from the DHCP server is sent to `myIpAddress`.
[source, xml]
----
<DhcpdConfiguration
       port="5818"
       macAddress="00:06:0D:BE:9C:B2"
       myIpAddress="10.4.1.234"
       extendedMode="true"
       requestIpAddress="targetSubnet">
</DhcpdConfiguration>
----

NOTE: If in `extendedMode`, the time required to complete the poll for an unresponsive node is increased by a factor of 3.
      Thus it is a good idea to limit the number of retries to a small number.
