==== SnmpMonitor

The SNMP monitor gives a generic possibility to monitor states and results from SNMP agents.
This monitor has two basic operation modes:

 - Test the response value of one specific _OID_ (scalar object identifier);
 - Test multiple values in a whole _table_.

To decide which mode should be used, the `walk` and `match-all` parameters are used.

See the ``Operating mode selection'' and ``Monitor specific parameters for the SnmpMonitor'' tables below for more information about these operation modes.

| `hex`             | Specifies that the value monitored should be compared against its hexadecimal representation.
                      Useful when the monitored value is a string containing non-printable characters.                 | optional | `false`
| `match-all`       | Can be set to: +
                      `count`: specifies that the value of at least minimum and at most maximum objects encountered in
                      the walk must match the criteria specified by `operand` and `operator`. +
                      `true` and `walk` is set to `true`: specifies that the value of *every* object encountered in
                      the walk must match the criteria specified by the `operand` and `operator` parameters. +
                      `false` and `walk` is set to `true`: specifies that the value of *any* object encountered in
                      the walk must match the criteria specified by the `operand` and `operator` parameters.           | optional | `true`
| `maximum`         | Valid only when `match-all` is set to `count`, otherwise ignored. Should be used in conjunction
                      with the `minimum` parameter. Specifies that the value of _at most_ `maximum` objects
                      encountered in the walk must meet the criteria specified by the `operand` and `operator`
                      parameters.                                                                                      | optional | `0`
| `minimum`         | Valid only when `match-all` is set to `count`, otherwise ignored. Should be used in conjunction
                      with the `maximum` parameter. Specifies that the value of _at least_ `minimum` objects
                      encountered in the walk must meet the criteria specified by the `operand` and `operator`
                      parameters.                                                                                      | optional | `0`
| `oid`             | The object identifier of the _MIB_ object to monitor.
                      If no other parameters are present, the monitor asserts that the agent's response for this
                      object must include a valid value (as opposed to an error, no-such-name, or end-of-view
                      condition) that is non-null.                                                                     | optional | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0` (SNMPv2-MIB::SysObjectID)
| `operand`         | The value to be compared against the observed value of the monitored object.
                      Note: Comparison will always succeed if either the `operand` or `operator` parameter isn't set
                            and the monitored value is non-null.                                                       | optional | `-`
| `operator`        | The operator to be used for comparing the monitored object against the `operand` parameter.
                      Must be one of the following symbolic operators: +
                      `&amp;lt;` (<): Less than. Both operand and observed object value must be numeric. +
                      `&amp;gt;` (>): Greater than. Both operand and observed object value must be numeric. +
                      `&amp;lt;=` (<=): Less than or equal to. Both operand and observed object value must be numeric. +
                      `&amp;gt;=` (>=): Greater than or equal to. Both operand and observed object value must be numeric. +
                      `=`: Equal to. Applied in numeric context if both operand and observed object value are numeric,
                           otherwise in string context as a case-sensitive exact match. +
                      `!=`: Not equal to. Applied in numeric context if both operand and observed object value are
                            numeric, otherwise in string context as a case-sensitive exact match. +
                      `~`:  Regular expression match. Always applied in string context. +
                      Note: Comparison will always succeed if either the `operand` or `operator` parameter isn't set
                            and the monitored value is non-null.
                      Keep in mind that you need to escape all < and > characters as XML entities (`&amp;lt;` and `&amp;gt;`
                      respectively)                                                                                    | optional | `-`

| `reason-template` | A user-provided template used for the monitor's reason code if the service is unvailable.
                      Defaults to a reasonable value if unset.
                      See below for an explanation of the possible template parameters.                                | optional | depends on operation mode

                      to `count`, in which case the `match-all` parameter takes precedence. +
                      `true`: Sets the monitor to poll for a tabular object where the `match-all` parameter defines how
                      the tabular object's values must match the criteria defined by the `operator` and `operand`
                      parameters. See also the `match-all`, `minimum`, and `maximum` parameters.                       | optional | `false`

===== Example for monitoring scalar object

As a working example we want to monitor the thermal system fan status which is provided as a scalar object ID.

 cpqHeThermalSystemFanStatus .1.3.6.1.4.1.232.6.2.6.4.0

The manufacturer _MIB_ gives the following information:


.Description of the cpqHeThermalSystemFanStatus from http://h18013.www1.hp.com/products/servers/management/hpsim/mibkit.html[CPQHLTH-MIB]
[source, asn1]
----
SYNTAX 	INTEGER  {
    other    (1),
    ok       (2),
    degraded (3),
    failed   (4)
}
ACCESS 	read-only
DESCRIPTION
"The status of the fan(s) in the system.

This value will be one of the following:
other(1)
Fan status detection is not supported by this system or driver.

ok(2)
All fans are operating properly.

degraded(3)
A non-required fan is not operating properly.

failed(4)
A required fan is not operating properly.

If the cpqHeThermalDegradedAction is set to shutdown(3) the
system will be shutdown if the failed(4) condition occurs."
----

The SnmpMonitor is configured to test if the fan status returns _ok(2)_. If so, the service is marked as _up_.
Any other value indicates a problem with the thermal fan status and marks the service _down_.

===== Example test SNMP table with all matching values

The second mode shows how to monitor values of a whole SNMP table.
As a practical use case the status of a set of physical drives is monitored.
This example configuration shows the status monitoring from the http://h18013.www1.hp.com/products/servers/management/hpsim/mibkit.html[CPQIDA-MIB].

We use as a scalar object id the physical drive status given by the following tabular OID:

 cpqDaPhyDrvStatus .1.3.6.1.4.1.232.3.2.5.1.1.6

    predictiveFailure (4)
}
ACCESS 	read-only
DESCRIPTION
Physical Drive Status.
This shows the status of the physical drive.
The following values are valid for the physical drive status:

other (1)
 Indicates that the instrument agent does not recognize
 the drive.  You may need to upgrade your instrument agent
 and/or driver software.

ok (2)
 Indicates the drive is functioning properly.

failed (3)
 Indicates that the drive is no longer operating and
 should be replaced.

predictiveFailure(4)
 Indicates that the drive has a predictive failure error and
 should be replaced.
----

The configuration in our monitor will test all physical drives for status _ok(2)_.

===== Example test SNMP table with all matching values

This example shows how to use the SnmpMonitor to test if the number of static routes are within a given boundary.
The service is marked as _up_ if at least 3 and at maxium 10 static routes are set on a network device.
This status can be monitored by polling the table _ipRouteProto_ from the http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1213.txt[RFC1213-MIB2].

 ipRouteProto 1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.9

The _MIB_ description gives us the following information:

}
ACCESS 	read-only
DESCRIPTION
"The routing mechanism via which this route was learned.
Inclusion of values for gateway routing protocols is not
intended to imply that hosts should support those protocols."
----

To monitor only local routes, the test should be applied only on entries in the _ipRouteProto_ table with value `2`.
The number of entries in the whole _ipRouteProto_ table has to be counted and the boundaries on the number has to be applied.

.Example SnmpMonitor used to test if the number of local static route entries are between 3 or 10.
