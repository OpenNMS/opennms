==== JCifsMonitor
This monitor allows to test a file sharing service based on the CIFS/SMB protocol.

WARNING: This monitor is not installed by default.
You have to install `opennmms-plugin-protocol-cifs` from your {opennms-product-name} installation repository.

With the _JCIFS_ monitor you have different possibilities to test the availability of the _JCIFS_ service:

With the _JCifsMonitor_ it is possible to run tests for the following use cases:

* share is available in the network
* a given file exists in the share
* a given folder exists in the share
* a given folder should contain at least one (1) file
* a given folder folder should contain no (0) files
* by testing on files and folders, you can use a regular expression to ignore specific file and folder names from the test

A network resource in SMB like a file or folder is addressed as a link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_%28computing%29#Uniform_Naming_Convention[UNC Path].

 \\server\share\folder\file.txt

The Java implementation _jCIFS_, which implements the _CIFS/SMB_ network protocol, uses _SMB_ URLs to access the network resource.
The same resource as in our example would look like this as an link:http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/smb[SMB URL]:

 smb://workgroup;user:password@server/share/folder/file.txt

The _JCifsMonitor_ can *not* test:

* file contains specific content
* a specific number of files in a folder, for example folder should contain exactly / more or less than x files
* Age or modification time stamps of files or folders
* Permissions or other attributes of files or folders

| Parameter           | Description                                                                                     | Required | Default value
| `retry`             | Number of retries before the service is marked as _down_.                                       | optional | `0`
| `domain`            | Windows domain where the user is located. You don't have to use the domain parameter if you use
                        local user accounts.                                                                            | optional | empty String
| `username`          | Username to access the resource over a network                                                  | optional | empty String
| `password`          | Password for the user                                                                           | optional | empty String
| `path`              | Path to the resource you want to test                                                           | required | empty String
| `mode`              | The test mode which has the following options +
                        `path_exist`: Service is _up_ if the resource is accessible +
                        `path_not_exist`: Service is _up_ if the resource is *not* accessible +
                        `folder_empty`: Service is _up_ if the folder is empty (0 files) +
                        `folder_not_empty`: Service is _up_ if the folder has at least one file                         | optional | `path_exist`
| `smbHost`           | Override the IP address of the SMB url to check shares on different file servers.               | optional | empty String
| `folderIgnoreFiles` | Ignore specific files in folder with regular expression. This parameter will just be applied on
                        `folder_empty` and `folder_not_empty`, otherwise it will be ignored.                            | optional | `-`
|===

This monitor implements the <<ga-service-assurance-monitors-common-parameters, Common Configuration Parameters>>.

TIP: It makes little sense to have retries higher than `1`.
     It is a waste of resources during the monitoring.

TIP: Please consider, if you are accessing shares with Mac OSX you have some side effects with the hidden file '.DS_Store.'
     It could give you false positives in monitoring, you can use then the `folderIgnoreFiles` parameter.

===== Example test existence of a file

This example shows how to configure the _JCifsMonitor_ to test if a file share is available over a network.
For this example we have access to a share for error logs and we want to get an outage if we have any error log files in our folder.
The share is named _log_.
The service should go back to normal if the error log file is deleted and the folder is empty.
