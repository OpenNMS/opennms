==== VmwareCimMonitor

This monitor is part of the VMware integration provided in _Provisiond_.
The monitor is specialized to test the health status provided from all _Host System_ (host) sensor data.

IMPORTANT: This monitor is only executed if the host is in power state _on_.

IMPORTANT: This monitor requires to import hosts with _Provisiond_ and the _VMware_ import.
           {opennms-product-name} requires network access to _VMware vCenter_ and the hosts.
           To get the sensor data the credentials from _vmware-config.xml_ for the responsible _vCenter_ is used.
           The following asset fields are filled from _Provisiond_ and is provided by _VMware_ import feature:
           _VMware Management Server_, _VMware Managed Entity Type_ and the _foreignId_ which contains an internal _VMware vCenter Identifier_.

The global health status is evaluated by testing all available host sensors and evaluating the state of each sensor.
A sensor state could be represented as the following:

 - _Unknown(0)_
 - _OK(5)_
 - _Degraded/Warning(10)_
 - _Minor failure(15)_
 - _Major failure(20)_
 - _Critical failure(25)_
 - _Non-recoverable error(30)_

The service is _up_ if *all* sensors have the status _OK(5)_.
If any sensor gives another status then _OK(5)_ the service is marked as _down_.
The monitor error reason contains a list of all sensors which not returned status _OK(5)_.

NOTE: In case of using link:http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/Distributed-Power-Management-vSphere.pdf[Distributed Power Management] the _standBy_ state forces a service _down_.
      The health status is gathrered with a direct connection to the host and in stand by this connection is unavailable and the service is _down_.
      To deal with stand by states, the configuration _ignoreStandBy_ can be used.
      In case of a stand by state, the service is considered as _up_.

state can be changed see the `ignoreStandBy` configuration parameter.
