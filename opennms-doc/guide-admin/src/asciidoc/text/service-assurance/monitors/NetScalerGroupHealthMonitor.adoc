==== NetScalerGroupHealthMonitor

This monitor is designed for _Citrix(R) NetScaler(R)_ loadbalancing checks.
It checks if more than x percent of the servers assigned to a specific group on a loadbalanced service are active.
The required data is gathered via SNMP from the _NetScaler(R)_.
The status of the servers is determined by the _NetScaler(R)_.
The provided service it self is not part of the check.
The basis of this monitor is the _SnmpMonitorStrategy_.
A valid SNMP configuration in _{opennms-product-name}_ for the _NetScaler(R)_ is required.

NOTE: A _NetScaler(R)_ can manage several groups of servers per application.
      This monitor just covers one group at a time.
      If there are multiple groups to check, define one monitor per group.

CAUTION: This monitor is not checking the loadbalanced service it self.

===== Examples

The following example checks a server group called _central_webfront_http_.
If at least 70% of the servers are active, the service is up.
If less then 70% of the servers are active the service is down.
A configuration like the following can be used for the example in the `poller-configuration.xml`.

[source, xml]
----
<service name="NetScaler_Health" interval="300000" user-defined="false" status="on">
   <parameter key="group-name" value="central_webfront_http" />
   <parameter key="group-health" value="70" />
</service>

<monitor service="NetScaler_Health" class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.poller.monitors.NetScalerGroupHealthMonitor” />

===== Details about the used SNMP checks

The monitor checks the status of the server group based on the _NS-ROOT-MIB_ using the _svcGrpMemberState_.
_svcGrpMemberState_ is part of the _serviceGroupMemberTable_.
The _serviceGroupMemberTable_ is indexed by _svcGrpMemberGroupName_ and _svcGrpMemberName_.
A initial lookup for the `group-name` is performed.
Based on the lookup the _serviceGroupMemberTable_ is walked with the numeric representation of the server group.
The monitor interprets just the server status code _7-up_ as active server.
Other status codes like _2-unknown_ or _3-busy_ are counted for total amount of servers.
