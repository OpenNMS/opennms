==== VmwareMonitor

This monitor is part of the VMware integration provided in _Provisiond_ and test the power state of a virtual machine (VM) or a host system (host).
If the power state of a VM or host is _poweredOn_ the service is _up_.
The state _off_ the service on the VM or Host is marked as _down_.
By default _standBy_ is also considered as _down_.
In case of using link:http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/Distributed-Power-Management-vSphere.pdf[Distributed Power Management] the _standBy_ state can be changed see the `ignoreStandBy` configuration parameter.

CAUTION: The information for the status of a virtual machine is collected from the responsible _VMware vCenter_ using the credentials from the _vmware-config.xml_.
         It is also required to get specific asset fields assigned to an imported virtual machine and host system.
         The following asset fields are required, which are populated by the _VMware_ integration in _Provisiond_: _VMware Management Server_, _VMware Managed Entity Type_ and the _foreignId_ which contains an internal _VMware vCenter Identifier_.
