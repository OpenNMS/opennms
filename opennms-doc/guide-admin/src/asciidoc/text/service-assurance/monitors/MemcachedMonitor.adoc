==== MemcachedMonitor

This monitor allows to monitor link:http://memcached.org[Memcached], a distributed memory object caching system.
To monitor the service availability the monitor tests if the _Memcached_ statistics can be requested.
The statistics are processed and stored in RRD files.
The following metrics are collected:
