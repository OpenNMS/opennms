=== Introduction

_{opennms-product-name}_ uses notifications to make users aware of an event.
Common notification methods are email and paging, but notification mechanisms also exist for:

* Arbitrary HTTP GET and POST operations
* Arbitrary external commands
* Asterisk call origination
* IRCcat Internet Relay Chat bot
* SNMP Traps
* Slack, Mattermost, and other API-compatible team chat platforms
* Twitter, GNU Social, and other API-compatible microblog services
* User-provided scripts in any JSR-223 compatible language
* XMPP

The notification daemon _Notifd_ creates and sends notifications according to configured rules when selected events occur in _{opennms-product-name}_.
