=== Concepts

_Notifications_ are how {opennms-product-name} informs users about an event that happened in the network, without the users having to log in and look at the UI.
The core concepts required to understand notifications are:

* Events and UEIs
* Users, Groups, and On-Call Roles
* Duty Schedules
* Destination Paths
* Notification Commands

These concepts fit together to form an _Event Notification Definition_.
Also related, but presently only loosely coupled to notifications, are _Alarms_ and _Acknowledgments_.

==== Events and UEIs

As discussed in the chapter on <<ga-events>>, events are central to the operation of {opennms-product-name}.
Almost everything that happens in the system is the result of, or the cause of, one or more events; Every notification is triggered by exactly one event.
A good understanding of events is therefore essential to a working knowledge of notifications.

Every event has a _UEI_ (Uniform Event Identifier), a string uniquely identifying the event's type.
UEIs are typically formatted in the style of a URI, but the only requirement is that they start with the string `uei.`.
Most notifications are triggered by an exact UEI match (though they may also be triggered with partial UEI matches using regular expression syntax).

==== Users, Groups, and On-Call Roles

_Users_ are entities with login accounts in the {opennms-product-name} system.
Ideally each user corresponds to a person.
They are used to control access to the web UI, but also carry contact information (e-mail addresses, phone numbers, etc.) for the people they represent.
A user may receive a notification either individually or as part of a _Group_ or _On-Call Role_.
Each user has several technology-specific contact fields, which must be filled if the user is to receive notifications by the associated method.

_Groups_ are lists of users.
A group may receive a notification, which is often a more convenient way to operate than on individual user.

_On-Call Roles_ are an overlay on top of groups, designed to enable {opennms-product-name} to target the appropriate user or users according to a calendar configuration.

==== Duty Schedules

Every _User_ and _Group_ may have a _Duty Schedule_, which specifies that user's (or group's) weekly schedule for receiving notifications.
If a notification should be delivered to an individual user, but that user is not on duty at the time, the notification will never be delivered to that user.
In the case of notifications targeting a user via a group, the logic differs slightly.
If the group is on duty at the time the notification is created, then all users who are also on duty will be notified.
If the group is on duty, but no member user is currently on duty, then the notification will be queued and sent to the next user who comes on duty.
If the group is off duty at the time the notification is created, then the notification will never be sent.

==== Destination Paths

A _Destination Path_ is a named, reusable set of rules for sending notifications.
Every destination path has an initial step and zero or more escalation steps.

Each step in a destination path has an associated delay which defaults to zero seconds. The initial step's delay is called the _initial delay_, while an escalation step's delay is simply called its _delay_.

Each step has one or more _targets_.
A target may be a user, a group, an on-call role, or a one-off e-mail address.

NOTE: While it may be tempting to use one-off e-mail addresses any time an individual user is to be targeted, it's a good idea to reserve one-off e-mail addresses for special cases. 
If a user changes her e-mail address, for instance, you'll need to update in every destination path where it appears.
The use of one-off e-mail addresses is meant for situations where a vendor or other external entity is assisting with troubleshooting in the short term.

When a step targets one or more groups, a delay may also be specified for each group.
The default is zero seconds, in which case all group members are notified simultaneously.
If a longer delay is set, the group members will be notified in alphabetical order of their usernames.

IMPORTANT: Avoid using the same name for a group and a user.
The destination path configuration does not distinguish between users and groups at the step level, so the behavior is undefined if you have both a user and a group named `admin`.
It is for this reason that the default administrators group is called `Admin` (with a capital `A`) -- case matters.

Within a step, each target is associated with one or more notification commands.
If multiple commands are selected, they will execute simultaneously.

Each step also has an _auto-notify_ switch, which may be set to `off`, `on`, or `auto`.
This switch specifies the logic used when deciding whether or not to send a notice for an auto-acknowledged notification to a target that was not on duty at the time the notification was first created.
If `off`, notices will never be sent to such a target; if `on`, they will always be sent; if `auto`, the system employs heuristics aimed at "doing the right thing".

==== Notification Commands

A _Notification Command_ is a named, reusable execution profile for a Java class or external program command used to convey notices to targets.
The following notification commands are included in the default configuration:

`callHomePhone`, `callMobilePhone`, and `callWorkPhone`::
    Ring one of the phone numbers configured in the user's contact information.
    All three are implemented using the in-process Asterisk notification strategy, and differ only in which contact field is used.

`ircCat`::
    Conveys a notice to an instance of the _IRCcat_ Internet Relay Chat bot.
    Implemented by the in-process IRCcat notification strategy.

`javaEmail` and `javaPagerEmail`::
    By far the most commonly used commands, these deliver a notice to a user's `email` or `pagerEmail` contact field value.
    By configuring a user's `pagerEmail` contact field value to target an email-to-SMS gateway, SMS notifications are trivially easy to configure.
    Both are implemented using the in-process JavaMail notification strategy.

`microblogDM`, `microblogReply`, and `microblogUpdate`::
    Sends a notice to a user as a direct message, at a user via an at-reply, or to everybody as an update via a microblog service with a Twitter v1-compatible API.
    Each command is implemented with a separate, in-process notification strategy.

`numericPage` and `textPage`::
    Sends a notice to a user's numeric or alphanumeric pager.
    Implemented as an external command using the `qpage` utility.

`xmppGroupMessage` and `xmppMessage`::
    Sends a message to an XMPP group or user.
    Implemented with the in-process XMPP notification strategy.

Notification commands are customizable and extensible by editing the `notificationCommands.xml` file.

NOTE: Use external binary notification commands sparingly to avoid fork-bombing your {opennms-product-name} system.
Originally, all notification commands were external.
Today only the `numericPage` and `textPage` commands use external programs to do their work.
