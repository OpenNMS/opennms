[[ga-notifications-getting-started]]
=== Getting Started

The status of notifications is indicated by an icon at the top right of the web UI's navigation bar.
_{opennms-product-name}_ installs with notifications globally disabled by default.

==== Enabling Notifications

To enable notifications in _{opennms-product-name}_, log in to the web UI as a user with administrator privileges. Hover over the user icon and click the _Configure OpenNMS_ link.
The controls for global notification status appear in the top-level configuration menu as _Notification Status_.
Click the _On_ radio button and then the _Update_ button.
Notifications are now globally enabled.

NOTE: The web workflow above is functionally equivalent to editing the `notifd-configuration.xml` file and setting `status="on"` in the top-level `notifd-configuration` element.
This configuration file change is picked up on the fly with no need to restart or send an event.

==== Configuring Destination Paths

To configure notification destination paths in _{opennms-product-name}_, navigate to _Configure OpenNMS_ and, in the _Event Management_ section, choose _Configure Notifications_.
In the resulting dialog choose _Configure Destination Paths_.

NOTE: The destination paths configuration is stored in the `destinationPaths.xml` file.
Changes to this file are picked up on the fly with no need to restart or send an event.

==== Configuring Event Notifications

Then choose _Configure Event Notifications_.

NOTE: The event notification configuration is stored in the `notifications.xml` file.
Changes to this file are picked up on the fly with no need to restart or send an event.
