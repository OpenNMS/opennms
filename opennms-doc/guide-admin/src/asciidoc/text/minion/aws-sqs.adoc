=== Using AWS SQS

By default, _{opennms-product-name}_ uses the embedded _ActiveMQ_ broker to communicate with _Minions_.
This broker is used for both issuing remote procedure calls (RPCs, ie. ping this host) and for transporting unsolicited messages such as SNMP traps and syslog messages.

_AWS SQS_ can be used as an alternative to _ActiveMQ_ for transporting the unsolicited messages.

WARNING: _AWS SQS_ cannot currently be used for handling RPC messages.
This means that _ActiveMQ_ is still required even when _AWS SQS_ support is enabled.

_AWS SQS_ must be enabled on both _{opennms-product-name}_ and _Minion_ to function.

The _AWS SQS_ server must be compatible with _AWS SQS_ client version `0.10.1.1_1`.

==== Consumer Configuration

Enable and configure the _AWS SQS_ consumer on _{opennms-product-name}_ by using the following commands. The `initialSleepTime` property will ensure that messages are not consumed from _AWS SQS_ until the _{opennms-product-name}_ system has fully initialized.

[source, sh]
----
echo 'org.opennms.core.ipc.sink.initialSleepTime=60000' > "$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/opennms.properties.d/sink-initial-sleep-time.properties"
echo 'org.opennms.core.ipc.sink.strategy=aws
org.opennms.core.ipc.sink.aws.aws_region=us-east-1' > "$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/opennms.properties.d/aws.properties"
----

If _{opennms-product-name}_ is not running inside an AWS VPC, the AWS Credentials are required. The credentials can be obtained from the local credentials file created through the AWS CLI tools (i.e. `~/.aws/credentials`),
or they can be specified inside the `aws.properties` file; for example:

[source, sh]
----
echo 'org.opennms.core.ipc.sink.strategy=aws
org.opennms.core.ipc.sink.aws.aws_region=us-east-1
org.opennms.core.ipc.sink.aws.aws_access_key_id=XXXXXXXXXXX
org.opennms.core.ipc.sink.aws.aws_secret_access_key=XXXXXXXXXXX' > "$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/opennms.properties.d/aws.properties"
----

Restart _{opennms-product-name}_ to apply the changes.

==== Producer Configuration

Enable the _AWS SQS_ producer on _Minion_ using:

[source, sh]
----
echo '!opennms-core-ipc-sink-camel
opennms-core-ipc-sink-aws' > "$MINION_HOME/etc/featuresBoot.d/aws.boot"
----

NOTE: The snippet above prevents the `opennms-core-ipc-sink-camel` feature from starting when _Minion_ is started, and loads the `opennms-core-ipc-sink-aws` feature instead.

Next, configure the _AWS SQS_ producer on _Minion_ using:

[source, sh]
----
echo 'aws_region=us-east-1
aws_access_key_id=XXXXXXXXXXX
aws_secret_access_key=XXXXXXXXXXX' > "$MINION_HOME/etc/org.opennms.core.ipc.sink.aws.cfg"
----

Restart _Minion_ to apply the changes.

==== SQS Configuration Settings

From the link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_SetQueueAttributes.html[AWS Documentation], the following parameters can be added to either Minion or _{opennms-product-name}_.

* `DelaySeconds` (defaults to 0 seconds)
* `MaximumMessageSize` (defaults to 262144 bytes)
* `MessageRetentionPeriod` (defaults to 1209600 seconds)
* `ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds` (defaults to 10 seconds)
* `VisibilityTimeout` (defaults to 30 seconds)
* `Policy`
* `RedrivePolicy`
