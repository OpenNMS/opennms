=== Using Off-heap Storage for Sink Messages

If a _Minion_ loses connectivity with the broker (i.e. _Kafka_ or _ActiveMQ_), then any received messages (i.e. syslog, flows, SNMP traps) are queued in the JVM heap until connectivity is restored.
This queue is limited by a fixed (and configurable) number of messages.
Once the queue is full, additional messages will be dropped.

The off-heap storage feature allows us to extend the storage capacity by queuing messages outside of the JVM heap.

NOTE: The current implementation of the off-heap storage supports storing messages in the system memory outside of the heap.
      No file-system based storage is currently support.

==== Configuring Off-heap Storage

Install off-heap feature on _Minion_:

[source, sh]
----
echo 'opennms-core-ipc-sink-offheap' >> "$MINION_HOME/etc/featuresBoot.d/features.boot"
----

Configure storage limits and enable the feature with:

[source, sh]
----
echo 'offHeapSize=1.2GB
enableOffHeap=true' > "$MINION_HOME/etc/org.opennms.core.ipc.sink.offheap.cfg"
----

Specify offHeapSize in KB, MB or GB. For ex: 1.2GB, 2.5MB, 845KB.
It will be converted to bytes.
In above example, offHeapSize is configured to 1.2GB.
That is 1288490188 bytes.
For ex: 1.2MB is valid.
1gb is not valid.
