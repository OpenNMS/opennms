=== Time to Live (ttl) for RPCs

RPC calls between _{opennms-product-name}_ and _Minion_ have certain time limit after which the requests are discarded.

For Service Monitors and Service Collectors the `interval` for the specific service will be the default ttl.

This can also be overwritten by specifying `ttl` as one of the parameters for the Service Monitors and Service Collectors.
The parameters can also specified as metadata which allows it to be populated per node/interface/service.

For SNMP services in provisioning and SNMP collector, `ttl` can also be specified in snmp config (snmp-config.xml)
Note that this overwrites any other ttl specified through parameters.

If no `ttl` is found in any of the ways specified above, default ttl for the RPC requests is `20000` msec (20 sec).
