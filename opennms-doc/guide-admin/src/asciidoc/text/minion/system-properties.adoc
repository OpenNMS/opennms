[[ga-minion-properties]]
=== System Properties

The `system.properties` file allows you to set global properties for the Minion application.
These properties will be set as system properties at the beginning of Java startup.
Any properties set on the Java command-line with `-Dproperty=value` will be overridden by these values.

Since the Minion application is able to use the same properties than OpenNMS does, the <<ga-snmp-settings, OpenNMS SNMP properties>> can be set.
