==== SNMP Traps

If SNMP-capable devices in the network are configured to send *traps* to {opennms-product-name}, these traps are transformed into events according to pre-configured rules. The `Trapd` service daemon, which enables {opennms-product-name} to receive SNMP traps, is enabled by default.

IMPORTANT: Disabling the `Trapd` service daemon will render {opennms-product-name} *incapable* of receiving SNMP traps.

Event definitions are included with {opennms-product-name} for traps from many vendors' equipment.
