==== TL1 Autonomous Messages

Autonomous messages can be retrieved from certain TL1-enabled equipment and transformed into events.

IMPORTANT: The `Tl1d` service daemon, which enables {opennms-product-name} to receive TL1 autonomous messages, must be enabled for this functionality to work. This service daemon is *disabled* by default.
