==== Sink

Events can also be created by routing them to a specific topic on _Kafka_ / _ActiveMQ_.

The topic name should be of the form  `OpenNMS`.Sink.Events where `OpenNMS` is default instance id of {opennms-product-name}.
The instance id is configurable through a system property `org.opennms.instance.id`.
