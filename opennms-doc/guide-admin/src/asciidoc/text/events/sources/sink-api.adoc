==== Sink

Events can also be created by routing them to a specific topic on _Kafka_/_ActiveMQ_.

The topic name should be of the form  `OpenNMS`.Sink.Events where `OpenNMS` is default instance id of {opennms-product-name}.
The instance id is configurable through a system property `org.opennms.instance.id`.

To enable Sink API to consume events, following system property needs to be added.
[source, sh]
----
echo 'org.opennms.netmgt.eventd.sink.enable=true' > "$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/opennms.properties.d/event-sink.properties"
----

For events to be consumed from _Kafka_, sink strategy should be changed to kafka by following commands.

[source, sh]
----
echo 'org.opennms.core.ipc.sink.strategy=kafka
org.opennms.core.ipc.sink.kafka.bootstrap.servers=127.0.0.1:9092' >> "$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/opennms.properties.d/kafka.properties"
----
