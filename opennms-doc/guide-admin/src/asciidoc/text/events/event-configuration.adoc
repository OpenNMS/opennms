=== Event Configuration
The back-end configuration surrounding events is broken into two areas: the configuration of `Eventd` itself, and the configuration of all types of events known to {opennms-product-name}.

==== The eventd-configuration.xml file

The overall behavior of `Eventd` is configured in the file `OPENNMS_HOME/etc/eventd-configuration.xml`.
This file does not need to be changed in most installations.
The configurable items include:

TCPAddress::
    The IP address to which the `Eventd` XML/TCP listener will bind. Defaults to `127.0.0.1`.
TCPPort::
    The TCP port number on `TCPAddress` to which the `Eventd` XML/TCP listener will bind. Defaults to `5817`.
UDPAddress::
    The IP address to which the `Eventd` XML/UDP listener will bind. Defaults to `127.0.0.1`.
UDPPort::
    The UDP port number on `TCPAddress` to which the `Eventd` XML/UDP listener will bind. Defaults to `5817`.
receivers::
    The number of threads allocated to service the event intake work done by `Eventd`.
queueLength::
    The maximum number of events that may be queued for processing. Additional events will be dropped. Defaults to unlimited.
getNextEventID::
    An SQL query statement used to retrieve the ID of the next new event. Changing this setting is not recommended.
socketSoTimeoutRequired::
    Whether to set a timeout value on the `Eventd` receiver socket.
socketSoTimeoutPeriod::
    The socket timeout, in milliseconds, to set if `socketSoTimeoutRequired` is set to `yes`.
logEventSummaries::
    Whether to log a simple (terse) summary of every event at level `INFO`. Useful when troubleshooting event processing on busy systems where `DEBUG` logging is not practical.


==== The eventconf.xml file and its tributaries

The set of known events is configured in `OPENNMS_HOME/etc/eventconf.xml`.
This file opens with a `<global>` element, whose `<security>` child element defines which event fields may not be overridden in the body of an event submitted via any `Eventd` listener.
This mechanism stops a mailicious actor from, for instance, sending an event whose `operator-action` field amounts to a phishing attack.

After the `<global>` element, this file consists of a series of `<event-file>` elements.
The content of each `<event-file>` element specifies the path of a *tributary file* whose contents will be read and incorporated into the event configuration.
These paths are resolved relative to the `OPENNMS_HOME/etc` directory; absolute paths are not allowed.

Each *tributary file* contains a top-level `<events>` element with one or more `<event>` child elements.
Consider the following event definition:

[source,xml]
----
   <event>
      <uei>uei.opennms.org/nodes/nodeLostService</uei>
      <event-label>OpenNMS-defined node event: nodeLostService</event-label>
      <descr>&lt;p>A %service% outage was identified on interface
            %interface% because of the following condition: %parm[eventReason]%.&lt;/p> &lt;p>
            A new Outage record has been created and service level
            availability calculations will be impacted until this outage is
            resolved.&lt;/p></descr>
      <logmsg dest="logndisplay">
            %service% outage identified on interface %interface%.
        </logmsg>
      <severity>Minor</severity>
      <alarm-data reduction-key="%uei%:%dpname%:%nodeid%:%interface%:%service%" alarm-type="1" auto-clean="false"/>
   </event>
----

Every event definition has this same basic structure.
See <<ga-events-anatomy-of-an-event,Anatomy of an Event>> for a discussion of the structural elements.

.A word about severities
When setting severities of events, it's important to consider each event in the context of your infrastructure as a whole.
Events whose severity is critical at the zoomed-in level of a single device may not merit a `Critical` severity in the zoomed-out view of your entire enterprise.
Since an event with `Critical` severity can never have its alarms escalated, this severity level should usually be reserved for events that unequivocally indicate a truly critical impact to the business.
Rock legend Nigel Tufnel offered https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xgx4k83zzc[some wisdom] on the subject.

.Replacement tokens
Various tokens can be included in the description, log message, operator instruction and automatic actions for each event.
These tokens will be replaced by values from the current event when the text for the event is constructed.
Not all events will have values for all tokens, and some refer specifically to information available only in events derived from SNMP traps.

`%eventid%`::
    The event's numeric database ID
`%uei%`::
    The Universal Event Identifier for the event.
`%source%`::
    The source of the event (which {opennms-product-name} service daemon created it).
`%time%`::
    The time of the event.
`%dpname%`::
    The ID of the Minion (formerly distributed poller) that the event was received on.
`%nodeid%`::
    The numeric node ID of the device that caused the event, if any.
`%nodelabel%`::
    The node label for the node given in `%nodeid%` if available.
`%host%`::
`%interface%`::
    The IP interface associated with the event, if any.
`%interfaceresolv%`::
    Does a reverse lookup on the `%interface%` and returns its name if available.
`%service%`::
    The service associated with the event, if any.
`%severity%`::
    The severity of the event.
`%snmphost%`::
    The host of the SNMP agent that generated the event.
`%id%`::
    The SNMP Enterprise OID for the event.
`%idtext%`::
    The decoded (human-readable) SNMP Enterprise OID for the event (?).
`%ifalias%`::
    The interface' SNMP ifAlias.
`%generic%`::
    The Generic trap-type number for the event.
`%specific%`::
    The Specific trap-type number for the event.
`%community%`::
    The community string for the trap.
`%version%`::
    The SNMP version of the trap.
`%snmp%`::
    The SNMP information associated with the event.
`%operinstruct%`::
    The operator instructions for the event.
`%mouseovertext%`::
    The mouse over text for the event.

.Parameter tokens
Many events carry additional information in *parameters* (see <<ga-events-anatomy-of-an-event,Anatomy of an Event>>).
These parameters may start life as SNMP trap *variable bindings*, or *varbinds* for short.
You can access event parameters using the `parm` replacement token, which takes several forms:

`%parm[all]%`::
    Space-separated list of all parameter values in the form `parmName1="parmValue1" parmName2="parmValue2"` and so on.
`%parm[values-all]%`::
    Space-separated list of all parameter values (without their names) associated with the event.
`%parm[names-all]%`::
    Space-separated list of all parameter names (without their values) associated with the event.
`%parm[<name>]%`::
    Will return the value of the parameter named `<name>` if it exists.
`%parm[##]%`::
    Will return the total number of parameters as an integer.
`%parm[#<num>]%`::
    Will return the value of parameter number `<num>` (one-indexed).
`%parm[name-#<num>]%`::
    Will return the name of parameter number `<num>` (one-indexed).

.The structure of the `eventconf.xml` tributary files
The ordering of event definitions is very important, as an incoming event is matched against them in order.
It is possible and often useful to have several event definitions which could match variant forms of a given event, for example based on the values of SNMP trap variable bindings.

The tributary files included via the `<event-file>` tag have been broken up by vendor. When {opennms-product-name} starts, each tributary file is loaded in order.
The ordering of events inside each tributary file is also preserved.

The tributary files listed at the very end of `eventconf.xml` contain catch-all event definitions.
When slotting your own event definitions, take care not to place them below these catch-all files; otherwise your definitions will be effectively unreachable.

.A few tips
* To save memory and shorten startup times, you may wish to remove event definition files that you know you do not need.
* If you need to customize some events in one of the default tributary files, you may wish to make a copy of the file containing only the customized events, and slot the copy above the original; this practice will make it easier to maintain your customizations in case the default file changes in a future release of {opennms-product-name}.

==== Reloading the event configuration

After making manual changes to `OPENNMS_HOME/etc/eventconf.xml` or any of its tributary files, you can trigger a reload of the event configuration by issuing the following command on the {opennms-product-name} server:

[source,sh]
----
OPENNMS_HOME/bin/send-event.pl uei.opennms.org/internal/reloadDaemonConfig -p 'daemonName Eventd'
----

=== Debugging

When debugging events, it may be helpful to lower the minimum severity at which `Eventd` will log from the default level of `WARN`.
To change this setting, edit `OPENNMS_HOME/etc/log4j2.xml` and locate the following line:

[source,xml]
----
        <KeyValuePair key="eventd"               value="WARN" />
----

Changes to `log42.xml` will be take effect within 60 seconds with no extra action needed.
At level `DEBUG`, `Eventd` will log a verbose description of every event it handles to `OPENNMS_HOME/logs/eventd.log`.
On busy systems, this setting may create so much noise as to be impractical.
In these cases, you can get terse event summaries by setting `Eventd` to log at level `INFO` and setting `logEventSummaries="yes"` in `OPENNMS_HOME/etc/eventd-configuration.xml`.
Note that changes to `eventd-configuration.xml` require a full restart of {opennms-product-name}.
