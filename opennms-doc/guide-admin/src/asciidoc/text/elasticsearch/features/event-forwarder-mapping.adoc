===== Mapping of Events to Elasticsearch

====== Overview of index mapping

In _{opennms-product-name}_, Event table entries contain references to associated node, asset, service and journal message tables.
In _Elasticsearch_, we must flatten these entries into a single index entry for each insertion. Thus each index entry contains 
more context information than would be found in the actual _{opennms-product-name}_ event. This context information includes the associated node
and asset table information which was current when (but may have changed since) the event was archived. 

In the _Table of Index Mappings_ below we have example event JSON entries retrieved using a sense command. The table helps illustrate how _{opennms-product-name}_
saves data in _Elasticsearch_.

Internal _Elasticsearch_ fields always begin with an underscore character. The internal fields `_id`, `_index` and `_type` are combined to give the unique identifier for an entry
as described above under Index Definitions. All of the fields under `_source` represent the stored event (_Elasticsearch_ documentation refers to source entries as indexed documents).
The ID of each event is included in the `_source` `id` field and also duplicated in the internal `_id`.

Events in the _{opennms-product-name}_ events table (i.e. those corresponding to logs or traps) are copied directly to the `opennms-events-raw-`
indexes. In _{opennms-product-name}_ events can contain `parameters` which are key-value pairs referencing additional data stored when the
event is created. In _Elasticsearch_ these parameters are always stored in separate fields in the index with names beginning with `p_`

Events have `severity` fields defined as integers (long) and also corresponding `severity_text` fields which give the
text equivalent (`Critical`, `Major`, `Minor`, `Normal`, `Cleared`).
