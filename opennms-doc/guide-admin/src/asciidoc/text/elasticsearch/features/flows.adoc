==== Flow Support

NOTE: _Flow Support_ is described in detail <<ga-flow-support, here>>.

When persisting flows into Elasticsearch, every flow is represented by a single document.

The following table describes a subset of the fields in the flow document:

[options="header, autowidth"]
|===

|`@timestamp`

  This will be `Default` unless you are using Minion.

|`netflow.bytes`
| Number of bytes transferred in the flow.

|`netflow.last_switched`
| Timestamp in milliseconds at which the last packet of the flow was transferred.

|`netflow.direction`

|`netflow.first_switched`
| Timestamp in milliseconds at which the first packet of the flow was transferred.

|`netflow.input_snmp`
| SNMP interface index on which packets related to this flow were received.
