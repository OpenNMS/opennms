===== Mapping of Alarms and Events to Elasticsearch

====== Overview of index mapping

In _{opennms-product-name}_, Alarm and Event table entries contain references to associated node, asset, service and journal message tables. 
In _Elasticsearch_, we must flatten these entries into a single index entry for each insertion. Thus each index entry contains 
more context information than would be found in the actual _{opennms-product-name}_ event or alarm. This context information includes the associated node
and asset table information which was current when (but may have changed since) the event was archived. 

In the _Table of Index Mappings_ below we have example alarm and event JSON entries retrieved using a sense command. The table helps illustrate how _{opennms-product-name}_
saves data in _Elasticsearch_.

Internal _Elasticsearch_ fields always begin with an underscore character. The internal fields `_id`, `_index` and `_type` are combined to give the unique identifier for an entry
as described above under Index Definitions. All of the fields under `_source` represent the stored alarm or event (_Elasticsearch_ documentation refers to source entries as indexed documents).
The ID of each event is included in the `_source` `id` field and also duplicated in the internal `_id`.

Events in the _{opennms-product-name}_ events table (i.e. those corresponding to logs or traps) are copied directly to the `opennms-events-raw-`
indexes. In _{opennms-product-name}_ alarms and events can contain `parameters` which are key-value pairs referencing additional data stored when the 
event or alarm is created. In _Elasticsearch_ these parameters are always stored in separate fields in the index with names beginning with `p_`

Alarm change events created by the _Alarm Change Notifier Plugin_ have an identical format to raw events 
but are only copied to the `opennms-events-alarmchange-` indexes. These alarm change events are also used to change 
the state of alarms in the `opennms-alarms-` indexes. Thus alarm entries in the `opennms-alarms-` indexes reflect the current state of 
alarms as notified by _{opennms-product-name}_ through alarm change events. 

The parameters included with each type of Alarm Change Event are listed in the _Alarm Change Notifier Plugin_ section. Each parameter in the index
will have a `p_` prefix (ie. `%parm[newalarmvalues]%` becomes `p_newalarmvalues`).

Alarms and Events have `severity` fields defined as integers (long) and also corresponding `severity_text` fields which give the 
text equivalent (`Critical`, `Major`, `Minor`, `Normal`, `Cleared`).

====== Additional Alarm Fields

The id of each alarm is included in the `_source` `alarmid` field and also duplicated in the internal `_id` reference for the alarms index. 
Alarm Change Events reference their associated alarm using the `p_alarmid` parameter. To make it easier to search for alarm change events associated
with the same alarm, alarms also have a `_source` `p_alarmid` parameter which matches `alarmid`. Thus we should be able to search for an alarm in the `opennms-alarms` index
and find its complete lifecycle from alarm raise to deletion in the `opennms-events-alarmchange` index.

The alarms index is enriched with additional data to allow the alarm entries to be used in SLA calculations.

| Additional Alarm Fields  | description 
| alarmackduration | Calculated time in milliseconds from first event which created the alarm to the latest alarm acknowledgement.
| alarmclearduration| Calculated time in milliseconds from first event which created the alarm to the latest alarm clear.
| initialseverity | The final state of any given alarm in an alarm index should be cleared and deleted. Therefore we also include an initial severity.
| initialseverity_text | The initial severity as a text field.
