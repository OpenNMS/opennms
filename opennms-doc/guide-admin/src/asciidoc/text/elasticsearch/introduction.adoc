_{opennms-product-name}_ persists/forwards certain data to _Elasticsearch_.

The following chapters describe the configuration possibilities as well as the available features.

Internally all _Elasticsearch_ integrations use the https://github.com/searchbox-io/Jest[Jest library] to access the _Elasticsearch_ ReST interface.

=== Configuration

The configuration is feature dependant and therefore must take place in the feature configuration file in `${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/org.opennms.features.flows.persistence.elastic.cfg`.

The following properties can be set:

[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Property | Description | Required | default

| _elasticUrl_
| URL(s) to Elasticsearch nodes. Can either point directly to ReST API or seed nodes. The format is: `<host>:<port>`. Comma separate multiple values.
| required
| `http://localhost:9200`

| _elasticIndexStrategy_
| Index strategy for data, allowed values _yearly_, _monthly_, _daily_, _hourly_
| optional
| `daily`

| _globalElasticUser_
| Username to use for all nodes, when link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/x-pack/current/setting-up-authentication.html[X-Pack Security] is configured.
| optional
| -

| _globalElasticPassword_
| Password to use for all nodes, when _X-Pack Security_ is configured.
| optional
| -

| _defaultMaxTotalConnectionPerRoute_
| Sets the default max connections per route. If a negative value is given, the value is ignored.
| optional
| `<available processors> * 2`

| _maxTotalConnection_

| _readTimeout_
| Defines the read timeout in ms.

| _bulkRetryCount_
| Defines the number of retries performed before a bulk operation is considered as failed.
When bulk operations fail, only the failed items are retried.
| optional
| `5`

| _settings.index.number_of_shards_
| The number of primary shards that an index should have. Refer to link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-modules.html#index-modules-setting[Elasticsearch Reference -> Index Modules] for more details.
| optional

| _settings.index.refresh_interval_
| How often to perform a refresh operation, which makes recent changes to the index visible to search. Refer to link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-modules.html#index-modules-setting[Elasticsearch Reference -> Index Modules] for more details.
| optional
| -

| _settings.index.routing_partition_size_

TIP: If a configuration management tool is used, the properties file can be created and is used as startup configuration

NOTE: If credentials are provided preemptive auth is used for all defined Elasticsearch nodes.

.Configuration Example to access Elasticsearch
[source]
----
elasticUrl=http://elastic:9200
elasticIndexStrategy=daily
elasticGlobalUser=elastic
elasticGlobalPassword=changeme
----

=== Credentials

It is possible to define credentials for each Elasticsearch node individually.
Credentials for each node must be stored in `${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/elastic-credentials.xml`.

.Custom credentials
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<elastic-credentials>
    <credentials url="http://localhost:9200" username="ulf" password="ulf" />
    <credentials url="https://10.10.0.1:9333" username="ulf" password="flu" />
</elastic-credentials>
```

NOTE: Credentials are globally defined and will be used by each feature.
