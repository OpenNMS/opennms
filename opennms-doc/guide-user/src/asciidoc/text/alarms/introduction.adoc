In _OpenNMS_ an _Alarm_ is used to allow more complex workflows dealing with issues for monitoring.
An _Alarm_ has his own life cycle and can be generated or cleared based on an _Event_.

The main component responsible creating an _Alarm_ is _Alarmd_.
It is a background process which is listening for _Events_ and evaluates the _Alarm definition_ and creates the _Alarm_.
_Alarmd_ can create an _Alarm_ with any kind of _Severity_ as _Unacknowledged Alarm_.

=== Acknowledge Alarms

_Alarms_ support workflows to indicate someone is taking care about a specific problem shown as an _Alarm_.
Every _Alarm_ can have _Sticky Notes_ to show what kind of problem happened and what was necessary to solve the issue.
By default an _Alarm_ has to be acknowledged through the web application.
