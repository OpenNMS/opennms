=== Alarm Notes

_{opennms-product-name}_ tells you if you have an outage and creates an _Alarm_.
Working with a few people in a Network Operation Center (NOC) it is necessary to share information about a current _Alarm_.
_Alarm Notes_ can be used to assign custom comments on a specific _Alarm_ or predefine a comment for a whole class of _Alarms_.

This section describes how to add and remove _Sticky_ and _Journal Memo_ information on _Alarms_.
The figure <<gu-alarm-notes-ui, Alarm Detail View>> shows the component to add these information in _Memos_ to the _Alarm_.

The _Alarm Notes_ allows you to add two types of notes on an existing _Alarm_ or _Alarm Class_:

* _Sticky Memo_: A user defined note for a specific instance of an _Alarm_.
                 Deleting the _Alarm_ will also delete the sticky memo.
* _Journal Memo_: A user defined note for a whole class of alarms based on the resolved reduction key.
                  It will be shown for all _Alarms_ matching a specific reduction key.
                  Deleting an alarm doesn't remove the _Journal Memo_, they can be removed by pressing the "Clear" button on an existing _Alarm_.

If an _Alarm_ has a sticky and/or a _Journal Memo_ it is indicated with two icons on the "Alarm list Summary" and "Alarm List Detail".
