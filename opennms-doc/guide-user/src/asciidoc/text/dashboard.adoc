[[user-guide-dashboard]]
== OpenNMS Dashboard

In Network Operation Centers _NOC_ an overview about issues in the network is important and often described as _Dashboards_.
Large networks have people (Operator) with different responsibilities and the _Dashboard_ should show only information for a given _monitoring context_.
Network or Server operator have a need to customize or filter information on the _Dashboard_.
A _Dashboard_ as an At-a-glance overview is also often used to give an entry point for more detailed diagnosis through the information provided by the monitoring system.
The _Surveillance View_ allows to reduce the visible information by selecting rows, columns and cells to quickly limit the amount of information to navigate through.

[[user-guide-dashboard-components]]
=== Dashboard Components

The _Dashboard_ is built with five components:

* _Surveillance View_: Allows to model a _monitoring context_ for the _Dashboard_.
* _Alarms_: Shows unacknowledged _Alarms_ which should be escalated by an _Operator_.
* _Notifications_: Shows outstanding and unacknowledged notifications sent to _Engineers_.
* _Node Status_: Shows all ongoing network _Outages_.
* _Resource Graph Viewer_: Shows performance time series reports for performance diagnosis.

The following screenshot shows a configured _Dashboard_ and which information are displayed in the components.

The following section describe the information shown in each component.
All other components display information based on the _Surveillance View_.

[[user-guide-dashboard-surveillance-view]]
==== Surveillance View

The _Surveillance View_ has multiple functions.

* Allows to model model the _monitoring context_ and shows service and node _Outages_ in compact matrix view.
* Allows to limit the number of information in the _Dashboard_ by selecting rows, columns and cells.

The following screenshots show all possible selections in the _Surveillance View_.

[[user-guide-dashboard-alarms]]
==== Alarms

The _Alarms_ component gives an overview about all unacknowledged _Alarms_ with a severity higher than _Normal(1)_.
Acknowledged _Alarms_ will be removed from the responsibility of the _Operator_.
The following information are shown in:

.Information displayed in the _Alarms_ component
image::dashboard/06_alarms-component.png[]

1. _Node_: Node label of the node the _Alarm_ is associated.
2. _Log Msg_: The log message from the _Event_ which is the source for this _Alarm_. It is specified in the event configuration file in `<logmsg />`
3. _Count_: Number of _Alarms_ deduplicated by the reduction key of the _Alarm_.
4. _First Time_: Time for the first occurrence of the _Alarm_.
5. _Last Time_: Time for the last occurrence of the _Alarm_.

The _Alarms_ component shows the 5 latest _Alarms_ and allows with pagination to navigate to older _Alarms_.

[[user-guide-dashboard-notifications]]
==== Notifications

To inform people on a duty schedule notifications are used and force action to fix or reconfigure systems immediately.
In _OpenNMS_ it is possible to acknowledge notifications to see who is working on a specific issue.
The _Dashboard_ should show outstanding notifications in the _NOC_ to provide an overview and give the possibility for intervention.

.Information displayed in the _Notifications_ component
image::dashboard/07_notifications-component.png[]

1. _Node_: Label of the monitored node the notification is associated with.
2. _Service_: Name of the service the notification is associated with.
3. _Message_: Message of the notification.
4. _Responder_: User name who acknowledged the notification
5. _Response Time_: Time when the user acknowledged the notification

The _Notifications_ component shows the last 8 unacknowledged notifications and allows with pagination to navigate to older unacknowledged notifications.

[[user-guide-dashboard-node-status]]
==== Node Status

An acknowledged _Alarm_ doesn't mean necessarily the outage is solved.
To give an overview information about ongoing _Outages_ in the network, the _Dashboard_ shows an outage list in the _Node Status_ component.

.Information displayed in the _Node Status_ component
image::dashboard/08_node-status-component.png[]

1. _Node_: Label of the monitored node with ongoing outages.
2. _Current Outages_: Number of services on the node with outages and total number of monitored services, e.g. with the natural meaning of _"3 of 3 services are affected"_.
3. _24 Hour Availability_: Availability of all services provided by the node calculated by the last 24 hours.

The _Node Status_ component shows the last 5 ongoing _Outages_ and allows with pagination to navigate to older _Outages_.

[[user-guide-dashboard-resource-graph-viewer]]
==== Resource Graph Viewer

To give a quick entry point diagnose performance issues a _Resource Graph Viewer_ allows to navigate to time series data reports which are filtered in the context of the _Surveillance View_.

.Show time series based performance with the _Resource Graph Viewer_
image::dashboard/09_resource-graph-viewer.png[]

It allows to navigate sequentially through resource graphs provided by nodes filtered by the _Surveillance View_ context and selection and shows one graph report at a time.

[[user-guide-dashboard-advanced-configuration]]
=== Advanced configuration

The _Surveillance View_ component allows to model multiple views for different monitoring contexts.
It gives the possibility to create special view as example for network operators or server operators.
The _Dashboard_ shows only *_one_* link:http://www.opennms.org/wiki/Dashboard[configured _Surveillance View_].
To give different users the possibility using their _Surveillance View_ fitting there requirements it is possible to map a logged in user to a given _Surveillance View_ used in the _Dashboard_.

The selected nodes from the _Surveillance View_ are also aware of link:http://www.opennms.org/wiki/User_Restriction_Filters[User Restriction Filter].
If you have a group of users, which should see just a subset of nodes the __Surveillance View_ will filter nodes which are not related to the assigned user group.
