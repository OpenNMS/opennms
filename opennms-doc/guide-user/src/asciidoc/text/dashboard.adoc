== {opennms-product-name} Dashboard

In Network Operation Centers _NOC_ an overview about issues in the network is important and often described as _Dashboards_.
Large networks have people (Operator) with different responsibilities and the _Dashboard_ should show only information for a given _monitoring context_.
Network or Server operator have a need to customize or filter information on the _Dashboard_.
A _Dashboard_ as an At-a-glance overview is also often used to give an entry point for more detailed diagnosis through the information provided by the monitoring system.
The _Surveillance View_ allows to reduce the visible information by selecting rows, columns and cells to quickly limit the amount of information to navigate through.

[[user-guide-dashboard-components]]
=== Dashboard Components

The _Dashboard_ is built with five components:

* _Surveillance View_: Allows to model a _monitoring context_ for the _Dashboard_.
* _Alarms_: Shows unacknowledged _Alarms_ which should be escalated by an _Operator_.
* _Notifications_: Shows outstanding and unacknowledged notifications sent to _Engineers_.
* _Node Status_: Shows all ongoing network _Outages_.
* _Resource Graph Viewer_: Shows performance time series reports for performance diagnosis.

The following screenshot shows a configured _Dashboard_ and which information are displayed in the components.

The following section describe the information shown in each component.
All other components display information based on the _Surveillance View_.

[[user-guide-dashboard-surveillance-view]]

==== Surveillance View

The _Surveillance View_ has multiple functions.

* Allows to model the _monitoring context_ and shows service and node _Outages_ in compact matrix view.
* Allows to limit the number of information in the _Dashboard_ by selecting rows, columns and cells.

You can select columns, rows, single cells and of course all entries in a _Surveillance View_.
Please refer to the <<user-guide-surveillance-view, Surveillance View Section>> for details on how to configure _Surveillance Views_.

.The _Surveillance View_ forms the basis for the _Dashboard_ page.

[[user-guide-dashboard-alarms]]
==== Alarms

The _Alarms_ component gives an overview about all unacknowledged _Alarms_ with a severity higher than _Normal(1)_.
Acknowledged _Alarms_ will be removed from the responsibility of the _Operator_.
The following information are shown in:

.Information displayed in the _Alarms_ component
image::dashboard/03_dashboard-alarms.png[]

1. _Node_: Node label of the node the _Alarm_ is associated
2. _Severity_: Severity of the _Alarm_
3. _UEI_: Shows the _UEI_ of the _Alarm_
4. _Count_: Number of _Alarms_ deduplicated by the reduction key of the _Alarm_
5. _Last Time_: Time for the last occurrence of the _Alarm_
6. _Log Msg_: The log message from the _Event_ which is the source for this _Alarm_. It is specified in the event configuration file in `<logmsg />`

The _Alarms_ component shows the most recent _Alarms_ and allows the user to scroll through the last 100 _Alarms_.

[[user-guide-dashboard-notifications]]
==== Notifications

To inform people on a duty schedule notifications are used and force action to fix or reconfigure systems immediately.
In _{opennms-product-name}_ it is possible to acknowledge notifications to see who is working on a specific issue.
The _Dashboard_ should show outstanding notifications in the _NOC_ to provide an overview and give the possibility for intervention.

.Information displayed in the _Notifications_ component
image::dashboard/04_dashboard-notifications.png[]

1. _Node_: Label of the monitored node the notification is associated with
2. _Service_: Name of the service the notification is associated with
3. _Message_: Message of the notification
4. _Sent Time_: Time when the notification was sent
5. _Responder_: User name who acknowledged the notification
6. _Response Time_: Time when the user acknowledged the notification

The _Notifications_ component shows the most recent unacknowledged notifications and allows the user to scroll through the last 100 _Notifications_.

[[user-guide-dashboard-node-status]]
==== Node Status

An acknowledged _Alarm_ doesn't mean necessarily the outage is solved.
To give an overview information about ongoing _Outages_ in the network, the _Dashboard_ shows an outage list in the _Node Status_ component.

.Information displayed in the _Node Status_ component
image::dashboard/05_dashboard-outages.png[]

1. _Node_: Label of the monitored node with ongoing outages.
2. _Current Outages_: Number of services on the node with outages and total number of monitored services, e.g. with the natural meaning of _"3 of 3 services are affected"_.
3. _24 Hour Availability_: Availability of all services provided by the node calculated by the last 24 hours.

[[user-guide-dashboard-resource-graph-viewer]]
==== Resource Graph Viewer

To give a quick entry point diagnose performance issues a _Resource Graph Viewer_ allows to navigate to time series data reports which are filtered in the context of the _Surveillance View_.

.Show time series based performance with the _Resource Graph Viewer_
image::dashboard/06_dashboard-resource-graphs.png[]

It allows to navigate sequentially through resource graphs provided by nodes filtered by the _Surveillance View_ context and selection and shows one graph report at a time.

[[user-guide-dashboard-advanced-configuration]]
=== Advanced configuration

The _Surveillance View_ component allows to model multiple views for different monitoring contexts.
It gives the possibility to create special view as example for network operators or server operators.
The _Dashboard_ shows only *_one_* configured <<user-guide-surveillance-view, _Surveillance View_>>.
To give different users the possibility using their _Surveillance View_ fitting there requirements it is possible to map a logged in user to a given _Surveillance View_ used in the _Dashboard_.

The selected nodes from the _Surveillance View_ are also aware of link:http://www.opennms.org/wiki/User_Restriction_Filters[_User Restriction Filter_].
If you have a group of users, which should see just a subset of nodes the _Surveillance View_ will filter nodes which are not related to the assigned user group.

The _Dashboard_ is designed to focus, and therefore also restrict, a user's view to devices of their interest.
To do this, a new role was added that can be assigned to a user that restricts them to viewing only the _Dashboard_ if that is intended.

==== Using the _Dashboard_ role

The following example illustrates how this _Dashboard_ role can be used.
For instance the user `drv4doe` is assigned the dashboard role.
So, when logging in as `drv4doe`, the user is taking directly to the _Dashboard_ page and is presented with a custom _Dashboard_ based on the `drv4doe` _Surveillance View_ definition.

===== Step 1: Create an user
The following example assigns a Dashboard to the user "drv4doe" (a router and switch jockey) and restricts the user for navigation to any other link in the {opennms-product-name} WebUI.

.Creating the user `drv4doe` using the {opennms-product-name} WebUI
image::dashboard/07_dashboard-add-user.png[]

===== Step 2: Change Security Roles
Now, add the `ROLE_PROVISION` role to the user through the WebUI or by manually editing the `users.xml` file in the `/opt/opennms/etc` directory for the user `drv4doe`.

.Adding dashboard role to the user `drv4doe` using the {opennms-product-name} WebUI

    <role>ROLE_DASHBOARD</role>
</user>
----

===== Step 3: Define Surveillance View
Edit the `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/surveilliance-view.xml` file to add a definition for the user _drv4doe_, which you created in step 1.

</surveillance-view-configuration>
----

This configuration and proper assignment of node categories will produce a default _Dashboard_ for all users, other than `drv4doe`.

TIP: You can hide the upper navigation on any page by specifying `?quiet=true;` adding it to the end of the _{opennms-product-name}_ URL.
This is very handy when using the dashboard on a large monitor or tv screen for office wide viewing.

However, when logging in as `drv4doe`, the user is taking directly to the _Dashboard_ page and is presented with a _Dashboard_ based on the custom _Surveillance View_ definition.

NOTE: The `drv4doe` user is not allowed to navigate to URLs other than the `dashboard.jsp` URL.
Doing so will result in an _Access Denied_ error.

==== Anonymous dashboards

You can modify the configuration files for the security framework to give you access to one or more dashboards without logging in.
At the end you'll be able to point a browser at a special URL like `http://.../opennms/dashboard1` or `http://.../opennms/dashboard2` and see a dashboard without any authentication.
First, configure surveillance views and create dashboard users as above.
For example, make two dashboards and two users called `dashboard1` and `dashboard2`.
Test that you can log in as each of the new users and see the correct dashboard.
Now create some aliases you can use to distinguish between dashboards.
In `/opt/opennms/jetty-webapps/opennms/WEB-INF`, edit `web.xml`.
Just before the first `<servlet-mapping>` tag, add the following servlet entries:
[source, xml]
----
  <servlet>
       <servlet-name>dashboard1</servlet-name>
       <jsp-file>/dashboard.jsp</jsp-file>
  </servlet>

  <servlet>
       <servlet-name>dashboard2</servlet-name>
       <jsp-file>/dashboard.jsp</jsp-file>
  </servlet>
----
Just before the first `<error-page>` tag, add the following servlet-mapping entries:
[source, xml]
----
  <servlet-mapping>
       <servlet-name>dashboard1</servlet-name>
       <url-pattern>/dashboard1</url-pattern>
  </servlet-mapping>

  <servlet-mapping>
       <servlet-name>dashboard2</servlet-name>
       <url-pattern>/dashboard2</url-pattern>
  </servlet-mapping>
----
After the last `<filter-mapping>` tag, add the following filter-mapping entries:
[source, xml]
----
  <filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>AddRefreshHeader-120</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/dashboard.jsp</url-pattern>
  </filter-mapping>
  <filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>AddRefreshHeader-120</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/dashboard1</url-pattern>
  </filter-mapping>
  <filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>AddRefreshHeader-120</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/dashboard2</url-pattern>
  </filter-mapping>
----
Next edit `applicationContext-acegi-security.xml` to enable anonymous authentication for the `/dashboard1` and `/dashboard2` aliases.
Near the top of the file, find `<bean id="filterChainProxy" ...>`.
Below the entry for `/rss.jsp*`, add an entry for each of the dashboard aliases:
[source, xml]
----
  <bean id="filterChainProxy" class="org.acegisecurity.util.FilterChainProxy">
    <property name="filterInvocationDefinitionSource">
      <value>
        CONVERT_URL_TO_LOWERCASE_BEFORE_COMPARISON
        PATTERN_TYPE_APACHE_ANT
        /rss.jsp*=httpSessionContextIntegrationFilter,logoutFilter,authenticationProcessingFilter,basicProcessingFilter,securityContextHolderAwareRequestFilter,anonymousProcessingFilter,basicExceptionTranslationFilter,filterInvocationInterceptor
        /dashboard1*=httpSessionContextIntegrationFilter,logoutFilter,securityContextHolderAwareRequestFilter,dash1AnonymousProcessingFilter,filterInvocationInterceptor
        /dashboard2*=httpSessionContextIntegrationFilter,logoutFilter,securityContextHolderAwareRequestFilter,dash2AnonymousProcessingFilter,filterInvocationInterceptor
        /**=httpSessionContextIntegrationFilter,logoutFilter,authenticationProcessingFilter,basicProcessingFilter,securityContextHolderAwareRequestFilter,anonymousProcessingFilter,exceptionTranslationFilter,filterInvocationInterceptor

...
----
About halfway through the file, look for `<bean id="filterInvocationInterceptor" ...>`.
Below the entry for `/dashboard.jsp`, add an entry for each of the aliases:
[source, xml]
----
  <bean id="filterInvocationInterceptor" class="org.acegisecurity.intercept.web.FilterSecurityInterceptor">

...

        /frontpage.htm=ROLE_USER,ROLE_DASHBOARD
        /dashboard.jsp=ROLE_USER,ROLE_DASHBOARD
        /dashboard1=ROLE_USER,ROLE_DASHBOARD
        /dashboard2=ROLE_USER,ROLE_DASHBOARD
        /gwt.js=ROLE_USER,ROLE_DASHBOARD

...
----
Finally, near the bottom of the page, add a new instance of `AnonymousProcessingFilter` for each alias.
[source, xml]
----
  <!-- Set the anonymous username to dashboard1 so the dashboard page
       can match it to a surveillance view of the same name. -->
  <bean id="dash1AnonymousProcessingFilter" class="org.acegisecurity.providers.anonymous.AnonymousProcessingFilter">
    <property name="key"><value>foobar</value></property>
    <property name="userAttribute"><value>dashboard1,ROLE_DASHBOARD</value></property>
  </bean>

  <bean id="dash2AnonymousProcessingFilter" class="org.acegisecurity.providers.anonymous.AnonymousProcessingFilter">
    <property name="key"><value>foobar</value></property>
    <property name="userAttribute"><value>dashboard2,ROLE_DASHBOARD</value></property>
  </bean>
----
Restart {opennms-product-name} and you should bring up a dashboard at `http://.../opennms/dashboard1` without logging in.

WARNING: There's no way to switch dashboards without closing the browser (or deleting the JSESSIONID session cookie).

WARNING: If you accidentally click a link that requires full user privileges (e.g. Node List), you'll be given a login form.
Once you get to the login form, there's no going back to the dashboard without restarting the browser.
If this problem bothers you, you can set `ROLE_USER` in addition to `ROLE_DASHBOARD` in your `userAttribute` property.
However this will give full user access to anonymous browsers.
