The free web-based service _IFTTT_ allows to combine web applications using simple conditional instructions.
Each supported service has several triggers that can be used to trigger actions of other services.
This allows for example to change brightness and color of a smart bulb, send messages or date to IoT devices.

The _{opennms-product-name}_ integration makes uses of the so-called "Webhooks" service, that allows to trigger actions when a specific web-request was received.
The basic operation is as follows: _{opennms-product-name}_ polls for alarms with associated nodes and matches a given category filter.
For the resulting alarm set the maximum severity and total count is computed.
If one of these values changed compared to the last poll one or more events specified for the computed maximum severity will be sent to _IFTTT_.

=== IFTTT Configuration

In order to use the _IFTTT_ integration in _{opennms-product-name}_ you need an _IFTTT_ account.
With this account you are able to create so-called applets that combine a trigger with an action.
In our case we use the "Webhooks" service as the trigger and define the event name `OpenNMS`.
After this step you can combine this trigger with any of the possible supported services and their actions.

In your account service settings for the "Webhooks" service you find your key in the given service URL.
In the following example this key is `X71dfUZsH4Wkl6cjsLjdV`.

On the side of _{opennms-product-name}_ you need a configuration that defines which event names to send on an alarm count or severity change.
The configuration file `ifttt-config.xml` contains so called trigger packages.

The operation is as follows:
_{opennms-product-name}_ retrieves all alarms that have a node associated.
Each trigger package defines whether only acknowledged alarms should be taken into account.
It then computes the maximum severity and alarm count for each trigger package's category filter.
After that it triggers all events defined in the corresponding trigger sets for the computed maximum severity.
The category filter accepts Java regular expressions.
Using an empty category filter will use all unacknowledged alarms with an associated node.

Each trigger inside a trigger set defines the event name to be triggered and three additional values.
These values can be used to set additional attributes for the corresponding _IFTTT_ applet action.
The following trigger sets can be defined:

[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Name     | Execution
| ON       | on start of the _IFTTT_ alarm polling daemon to switch on a device
| OFF      | on stop of the _IFTTT_ alarm polling daemon to switch off a device
| NORMAL   | if severity is NORMAL
| WARNING  | if severity is WARNING
| MINOR    | if severity is MINOR
| MAJOR    | if severity is MAJOR
| CRITICAL | if severity is CRITICAL
|===

There are also `ON` and `OFF` available for the trigger set definition.
The `ON` event will be sent when the polling daemon is started and the `OFF` when it is stopped.
These events can be used to powering up/down and initializing devices.

=== OpenNMS Configuration

_IFTTT_ alarm polling will be enabled by setting the attribute `enabled` to `true` in the `ifttt-config.xml` file.
It is also possible to configure the polling interval.
The following trigger package defined the trigger sets which itself define a sequence of events to be triggered at _IFTTT_.
Each trigger defines the `eventName` and an additional delay.
This allows to defer the execution of the next trigger in a trigger set.

=== Example

The following example shows the configuration file for a WiFi light bulb controlled via _IFTTT_.
The defined applets use `value1` for setting the color and `value2` for setting the brightness.
The third value demonstrate the use of placeholders.
For the severity-based trigger sets the following placeholders can be used in the three value fields:
`%os%`/`%oldSeverity` for old severity, `%ns%`/`%newSeverity%` for new severity, `%oc%`/`%oldCount` for old alarm count and `%nc%`/``%newCount% for new alarm count.
This is useful for sending messages or operating LED displays via _IFTTT_.
