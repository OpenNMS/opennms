== {opennms-product-name} Surveillance View

When networks are larger and contain devices of different priority, it becomes interesting to show at a glance how the "whole system" is working.
The surveillance view aims to do that. By using categories, you can define a matrix which allows to aggregate monitoring results.
Imagine you have 10 servers with 10 internet connections and some 5 PCs with DSL lines:

[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
|                    | Servers | Internet Connections
| Super important    | 1 of 10 | 0 of 10
| Slightly important | 0 of 10 | 0 of 10
| Vanity             | 4 of 10 | 0 of 10
|===

The whole idea is to give somebody at a glance a hint on where the trouble is.
The matrix-type of display allows a significantly higher aggregation than the simple list.
In addition, the surveillance view shows nodes rather than services - an important tidbit of information when you look at categories.
At a glance, you want to know how many of my servers have an issue rather than how many services in this category have an issue.

.Example of a configured _Surveillance View_
image::surveillance-view/01_surveillance-view.png[]

The visual indication for outages in the surveillance view cells is defined as the following:

* No services down: green as normal
* One (1) service down: yellow as warning
* More than one (1) services down: red as critical

This _Surveillance View_ model also builds the foundation of the <<user-guide-dashboard, Dashboard View>>.


=== Default Surveillance View Configuration

_Surveillance Views_ are defined in the `surveillance-views.xml` file.
This file resides in the _{opennms-product-name}_ `etc` directory.

NOTE: This file can be modified in a text editor and is reread every time the _Surveillance View_ page is loaded.
Thus, changes to this file do not require _{opennms-product-name}_ to be restarted.

The default configuration looks like this:

[source, xml]

      </rows>
      <columns>
        <column-def label="PROD" >
          <category name="Production" />
        </column-def>
        <column-def label="TEST" >
          <category name="Test" />
        </column-def>
        <column-def label="DEV" >
          <category name="Development" />
        </column-def>
      </columns>
    </view>
  </views>
</surveillance-view-configuration>

WARNING: Please note, that the old `report-category` attribute is deprecated and is no longer supported.

=== Configuring Surveillance Views
The _Surveillance View_ configuration can also be modified using the _Surveillance View Configurations_ editor on the _{opennms-product-name}_ _Admin_ page.

.The _Surveillance View Configurations_ UI
image::surveillance-view/02_surveillance-view-config-ui.png[]

This page gives an overview of the configured _Surveillance Views_ and allows the user to edit, remove or even preview the defined _Surveillance View_.
Furthermore, the default _Surveillance View_ can be selected using the checkbox in the _DEFAULT_ column.

When editing a _Surveillance View_ the user has to define the view's title and the time in seconds between successive refreshes.
On the left side of this dialog the defined rows, on the right side the defined columns are listed.
Beside adding new entries an user can modify or delete existing entries.
Furthermore, the position of an entry can be modified using the up/down buttons.

.Editing a _Surveillance View_
image::surveillance-view/03_surveillance-view-config-ui-edit.png[]

Editing row or column definitions require to choose an unique label for this entry and at least one _{opennms-product-name}_ category.
When finished you can hit the _Save_ button to persist your modified configuration or _Cancel_ to close this dialog.

=== Categorizing Nodes

In order to categorize nodes in the Surveillance View, choose a node and click _Edit_ beside _Surveillance Category Memberships_.
Recalling from your _Surveillance View_, choose two categories that represent a column and a row, for example, _Servers_ and _Test_, then click _Add_.

=== Creating Views for Users and Groups

You can use user and group names for _Surveillance Views_. When the _Surveillance View_ page is invoked the following criteria selects the proper _Surveillance View_ to be displayed.
The first matching item wins:

. Surveillance View name equal to the user name they used when logging into {opennms-product-name}.
. Surveillance View name equal to the user's assigned {opennms-product-name} group name
. Surveillance View name equal to the `default-view` attribute in the `surveillance-views.xml` configuration file.
