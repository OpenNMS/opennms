=== Path Outage

An outage of a central core component can cause a lot of node outages and notifications.
For this reason it is possible to define a _Critical Path_.
The _Critical Path_ has to be defined from the network perspective of the monitoring system.
The following image shows a simple example how devices can be reached in a Layer 3 network topology.

In figure <<path-outage-example, Path Outage example>> implies a network Layer 3 topology.
From the perspective of the monitoring system, _default-gw-01_ is on the _Critical Path_ to two networks.
In case _default-gw-01_ is down, it is not possible to reach any node in the two networks behind _default-gw-01_.
To guide a network administrator to the correct problem, _Notifications_ to all other unreachable _Nodes_ based on the _Critical Path_ are suppressed.
The administrator will get just one _Notification_ for the _default-gw-01_.
