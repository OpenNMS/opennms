This section will cover the basic functionalities how _OpenNMS_ monitors availability and latency from applications or management agents.
To change the behavior of how _OpenNMS_ monitors applications or status information from management agents please see the _Administration Guide_.
To extend the _Service Monitor_ framework please see the _Development Guide_.

Measuring availability and latency of network services or applications is an important part in fault and performance management.
In _OpenNMS_ this task is provided by a _Service Monitor_ framework.
The main component is _Pollerd_ which provides the following functionalities:

* Track the status of a management resource or an application for availability calculations
* Measure response times for service quality
* Correlation of node and interface outages based on a <<gu-service-assurance-critical-service, Critical Service>>

The following image shows the model and representation of availability and response time.

This information is based on _Service Monitors_ which are scheduled and executed by _Pollerd_.
A _Service_ can have any arbitrary name and is associated with a _Service Monitor_.
For example, we can define two _Services_ with the name _HTTP_ and _HTTP-8080_, both are associated with the _HTTP Service Monitor_ but use a different _TCP port_ configuration parameter.
The following figure shows how _Pollerd_ interacts with other components in _OpenNMS_ and applications or agents to be monitored.

The availability is calculated over the last 24 hours and is shown in the _Surveillance Views_, _SLA Categories_ and the _Node Detail Page_.
Response times are displayed as _Resource Graphs_ of the _IP Interface_ on the _Node Detail Page_.
Configuration parameters of the _Service Monitor_ can be seen in the _Service Page_ by clicking on the _Service Name_ on the _Node Detail Page_.
The status of a _Service_ can be _Up_ or _Down_.

When a _Service Monitor_ detects an outage, _Pollerd_ sends an _Event_ which is used to create an _Alarm_.
_Events_ can also be used to generate _Notifications_ for on-call network or server administrators.
The following images shows the interaction of _Pollerd_ in _OpenNMS_.

_Pollerd_ can generate the following _Events_ in _OpenNMS_:

[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Event name | Description
| `uei.opennms.org/nodes/nodeLostService`     | _Critical Services_ are still up, just this service is lost.
| `uei.opennms.org/nodes/nodeRegainedService` | Service came back up
| `uei.opennms.org/nodes/interfaceDown`       | _Critical Service_ on an IP interface is down or all services are down.
| `uei.opennms.org/nodes/interfaceUp`         | _Critical Service_ on that interface came back up again
| `uei.opennms.org/nodes/nodeDown`            | All critical services on all IP interfaces are down from node.
                                                The whole host is unreachable over the network.
| `uei.opennms.org/nodes/nodeUp`              | Some of the _Critical Services_ came back online.
|===

The behavior to generate _interfaceDown_ and _nodeDown_ events is described in the <<gu-service-assurance-critical-service, Critical Service>> section.

NOTE: This assumes that node-outage processing is enabled.
