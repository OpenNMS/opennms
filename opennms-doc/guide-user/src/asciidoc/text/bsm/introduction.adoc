_OpenNMS_ provides a very powerful and fine grained service assurance layer based on the _Pollerd_ daemon.
The service assurance layer monitors and tracks the status of nodes, interfaces and services.
The status of a managed entity is determined based on related events, alarms and outages.
However, this approach treats every element of the system individually and there is no concept of relationships between different nodes or services in the service assurance layer.

The _Business Service Monitoring_ (BSM) feature adds the ability to model relationships between managed entities.
It combines sets of managed entities into hierarchically structured _Business Services_ that represent a high level view on its elements.
The _Business Service_ operational status is calculated from the alarm states of its associated elements determined by the service assurance layer.
The operational status of a _Business Service_ can be checked at any time.
If the operational status of a _Business Service_ is changing corresponding events are fired.

The _Business Service Monitoring (BSM)_ component helps to quickly identify most critical problems affecting your services.
While OpenNMS detects issues in your network on a per network device level, the _BSM_ takes one step further.
It allows to model _BS_ on a more abstract level independent of network nodes, services or interfaces.

The _Business Service_ status is driven by _Alarms_ and can contain other _Business Services_ to build a _Business Service Hierarchy_.
A _BS_ is represented as an _Operational Status_ and

_Oper_ status is used to indicate the impact on a _Business Service_ based on outage- or threshold alarms from your monitored network.
In this hierarchy there is also a possibility to identify the root cause which affects this service.

The _Business Service Monitoring_ has the following components:

* _BSMD_: The component to calculate the status for the _Business Service Hierarchy_
* _Business Service Editor_: Component in the admin web application which allows you to create, update or delete _Business Services_
* _Topology View for Business Services_: Visual representation of the _Business Service Hiearchy_ as a component of the _Topology User Interface_.
* _BSM ReST API_: ReST based API to create, update or query _Business Services_ with external applications

NOTE: This guide is focused on basic concepts and how to use it from a users perspective.
      Changing the behavior and configuration please go to the <<ga-bsm, Administrative Guide>>.
      If you want to use the _ReST API_ or want to enhance the functionality with code, plsee see the <<dg-bsm, Developers Guide>>.
