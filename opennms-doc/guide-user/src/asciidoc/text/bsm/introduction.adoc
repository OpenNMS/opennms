The _Business Service Monitoring_ component helps you to quickly identify most critical problems affecting your services.
While OpenNMS detects issues in your network on a per device level, the _Business Service Monitoring_ takes one step further.
It allows to model _Business Services_ on a more abstract level and are different from network devices like switches, servers, routers or a virtual machines.
The _Business Service_ status is driven by specific monitored _Services_ and are driven by a specific set of _Alarms_ and can contain other _Business Services_ to build a hierarchy.
_Alarm_ status is used to indicate the impact on a _Business Service_ based on outage- or threshold alarms from your monitored network.
In this hierarchy there is also a possibility to identify the root cause which affects this service.

The _Business Service Monitoring_ has the following components:

* _BSMD_: The component to calculate the status for the _Business Service Hierarchy_
* _Business Service Editor_: Component in the admin web application which allows you to create, update or delete _Business Services_
* _Topology View for Business Services_: Visual representation of the _Business Service Hiearchy_ as a component of the _Topology User Interface_.
* _BSM ReST API_: ReST based API to create, update or query _Business Services_ with external applications

NOTE: This guide is focused on basic concepts and how to use it from a users perspective.
      Changing the behavior and configuration please go to the <<ga-bsm, Administrative Guide>>.
      If you want to use the _ReST API_ or want to enhance the functionality with code, plsee see the <<dg-bsm, Developers Guide>>.
