=== Root Cause and Impact Analysis

The _Root Cause_ operation can be used to quickly identify the underlying _Reduction Keys_ edges that contribute to the current _Operational Status_ of an element.


The _Impact Analysis_ operation, converse to the _Root Cause_ operation, can be used to identify all of the _BS_ affected by a given element.


Both of these options are available in the context menu of the _Topology User Interface_ when visualizing _BS_.
