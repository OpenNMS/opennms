=== Simulation Mode

To visualize if the configured behavior works as expected, the _Simulation Mode_ can be used to manually set an _Alarm_ status of an _Edge_ element.
The _Operational Status_ is calculated with the given _Map and Reduce Functions_.
This allows users to validate and tune their _Business Service Hierarchies_ until the desired status propagation is achieved.

In order to enter _Simulation Mode_, open the _Business Service View_ in the _Topology User Interface_ and toggle the _Simulation Mode_ option in the _Simulate_ menu at the top of the screen.
The _Info Panel_ on the left hand side allows to set the _Severity_ of the selected _Edge_ element.
In figure <<gu-bsm-simulate,BSM Simulation Mode>> the _Menu_ and _Severity_ setting is shown.

NOTE: The _Info Panel_ can be hidden with the _Arrow_ button in the top left corner.

In the _Simulate_ menu there are _Inherite State_ and _Reset State_ as options available.
With _Inherite State_ the current _Severities_ and _Operational Status_ from monitoring is used for the _Simulation Mode_.
By selecting _Reset State_ all states will be set to _Normal_ for simulation.
