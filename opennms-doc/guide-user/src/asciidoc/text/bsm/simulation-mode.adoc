=== Simulation Mode

_Simulation Mode_ allows users to _simulate_ the presence of alarms with specific severities.
This allows users to validate and tune their _Business Service Hierarchies_ until the desired status propagation is achieved.

In order to enter _Simulation Mode_, open a _Business Service Hierarchy_ in the _Topology User Interface_ and toggle the _Simulation Mode_ option in the _Simulate_ menu at the top of the screen.
