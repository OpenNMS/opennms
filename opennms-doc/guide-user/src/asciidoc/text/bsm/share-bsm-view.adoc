[[gu-bsm-share-view]]
=== Share View

In some cases it is useful to share a specific view on a _Business Service Hierarchy_.
For this reason the menu function _Share_ can be used and generates a link for the current view and can be copied and sent to another user.
In figure <<gu-bsm-share-view-image, Share Business Service View>> the _Share_ menu item was used and a link is generated.
The link can be used with _Copy & Paste_ and sent to another user to have access to exactly the same configured _Business Service View.

NOTE: The user receiving the link needs an account in OpenNMS to be able to see the _Business Service View_.
