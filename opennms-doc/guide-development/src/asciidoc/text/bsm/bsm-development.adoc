==== Business Service Monitoring

Every aspect of the _Business Service Monitoring_ feature can be controlled via a ReST API.
The API's endpoint for managing _Business Services_ is located at `/opennms/api/v2/business-services`.
It supports _XML_ content to represent the _Business Services_.
The responses generated by the ReST API do also include `location` elements that contain references to other entities managed by the API.
The _Business Service_ response data model for the ReST API has the following basic structure:
