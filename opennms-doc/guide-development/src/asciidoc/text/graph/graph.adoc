This section covers the insides of the new _Graph Service API_.
The _Graph Service API_ was heavily inspired by the link:http://graphml.graphdrawing.org[GraphML] model and the original Topology API.


[[ga-development-graph-service-api-terminology]]
=== Terminology

A *Graph* consists of any number of points with any number of connections in between.
Usually these points are called *Nodes*, but as *Nodes* have a specific meaning in _{opennms-product-name}_ in the context of the _Graph Service_ they are called *Vertices* (plural of *Vertex*).
The connection between two *Vertices* are usually called *Link*, however it also has a specific meaning inside _{opennms-product-name}_, thus it is called *Edge*.
A *Graph Container* contains any number of *Graphs*.
In general an *Element* can either be a *Graph*, *Vertex* or *Edge*.


=== Graph Model

[[ga-development-graph-service-api-generic-model]]
==== Generic Graph Model

The _Generic Graph Model_ is very similar to link:http://graphml.graphdrawing.org[GraphML]'s model and consists of the basic elements:

* `GenericGraphContainer`,
* `GenericGraph`,
* `GenericVertex` and
* `GenericEdge`

Each of the above have besides their designated functionality described in link:#ga-development-graph-service-api-terminology[Terminology] also properties assigned to them.
Some properties are mandatory and determined by the element's type.
Others are optionally and totally up to the entity providing a graph to the system.

The following rules apply to the _Generic Graph Model_:

- Each Graph container must be uniquely identified.
  This identifier is called a `container id`
  The `container id` must be unique overall containers and graph namespaces.
- Each Graph must be uniquely identified over all graphs (meaning the namespace must be unique throughout the system).
  This identifier is called a `namespace`.
  Each `namespace` must be unique overall container ids and graph namespaces.
- Each Vertex and Edge must be uniquely identified by an identifier.
  This identifier is called an `id`.
  The `id` must not be unique in the system, but within the graph.
- Each Vertex and Edge have the same `namespace` as the Graph they are part of.
  This allows to uniquely identify vertices and edges throughout the system.
- Each Graph, Vertex or Edge have additional properties to define their nature in more detail.
  E.g. a Vertex may contain a `label`, `node` or `location` property.
- Each Edge contains the source and target id of the Vertex it connects, therefore is ALWAYS directed.
- Each edge may reference Vertices from a different Graph (`namespace`).
  However at least one side must share the same `namespace` as the edge itself.
  This is the "owning" side, thus the edge will be a member of that Graph.


NOTE:   A graph may define a property `id` besides the property `namespace`.
        This is mostly only relevant, when importing graphs via GraphML as each graph element must have an `id` attribute set.
        When importing such GraphML each imported graph will have a `namespace` and `id` property set.
        In general, it is recommended, that the value of the attribute `id` SHOULD be identically to the `namespace` property even if it MUST NOT.

Refer to module `features/graph/api` in package `org.opennms.netmgt.graph.api.generic` for implementation details.


==== Domain Graph Model

A _Domain Graph Model_ is a model implementing a use case in its domain using the _Generic Graph Model_.
This can be achieved by simply using the _Generic Graph Model_ and setting the according properties.
For more complex use cases a more Java-friendly way - Basic Domain objects are available - to act as a "view" on the _Generic Graph Model_ to provide a more convenient implementation.
These domain objects don't hold information on their own but provide only access to information that can be deducted from the underlying Generic Model and it's properties.

NOTE:   For the _Domain Graph Model_ the same rules apply as for the link:#ga-development-graph-service-api-generic-model[Generic Graph Model].

See `features/graph/provider/bsm` for a domain model using the basic domain graph classes (`AbstractDomainGraph`, `AbstractDomainVertex`, etc).

See `features/graph/provider/graphml` for a domain model using the Generic Graph Model classes.


==== Immutability

The graph container and all it's elements are immutable once created.
In order to fully create a container various builders are provided.


=== Providers

To get a new graph or graph container to the system either a `GraphContainerProvider` or `GraphProvider` must be implemented and exposed via the OSGi-registry.
The latter is a convenient way of exposing a container which only consists of one graph.


==== Meta Information

Loading a graph container or graph may be very expensive.
Especially, if only the meta data are of interest (e.g. label, description).
Therefore each provider allows to fetch the meta data only without loading the graph or container.


=== Cache

All calls to `GraphContainerProvider.loadGraphContainer()` are cached until _{opennms-product-name}_ restarts.
This means it is up to the implementor to invalidate the cache.

This can be achieved by manually invoking the `org.opennms.netmgt.graph.api.service.GraphContainerCache.invalidate(String containerId)` method as the `GraphContainerCache` is exposed as an OSGi-service.
Alternatively a service property can be used to invalidate a cache entry after it was first populated to the cache:

```xml
<service interface="org.opennms.netmgt.graph.api.service.GraphProvider" ref="applicationGraphProvider">
    <service-properties>
        <entry key="cacheInvalidateInterval" value="300" /> <!-- seconds -->
    </service-properties>
</service>
```


=== Search

The goal behind searching is usually to bring one or more vertices into the focus of the user.
Usually the user searches for something like a node label or category name.
Mostly, those things do not directly relate to any element in the graph.

Therefore a search always consists of the following process:

1. Search for a concrete item in the system (e.g. node, vertex, category)
1. Resolve all vertices which match the concrete item.

Internally `SearchProvider` are used which allow to first make suggestions based on an input.
A `NodeSearchProvider` might return a list of suggestions representing nodes in the system.
The `NodeSearchProvider` knows how to "resolve" that selection to a unique set of vertices after the user selected one.

NOTE:   At the moment searching is ALWAYS performed in the context of a given namespace.
        Searching over multiple namespaces is not supported or encouraged.


=== Focus / Semantic Zoom Level / View

The focus itself is a list of vertices within the graph.
The _Semantic Zoom Level_ (or `szl`) indicates the number of hops (= distance) a vertex may be away from any vertex within the focus to be shown.
If the _Semantic Zoom Level_ is `0` only the vertices in focus are shown.

The applied _Semantic Zoom Level_ and _Focus_ is called a _View_ of the graph.

If the focus contains elements which are not part of the graph, they are not shown.

The _Graph Service API_ allows to create a view on any given graph considering a custom or default focus as well as the semantic zoom level.
If no focus is provided when requesting the view, the default focus is applied.


=== Listening for Changes

It is possible to listen for graph or graph container changes.
Various listeners can be exposed as an OSGi-service.

The calculation of changes must be triggered manually.
To do so, use the `org.opennms.netmgt.graph.api.updates.GraphNotificationService` service, which is exposed as an OSGi service

Refer to package `org.opennms.netmgt.graph.api.updates` in module `features/graph/api` for available options.

=== Persistence

Each graph or graph container can be persisted to the database using the `org.opennms.netmgt.graph.api.persistence.GraphRepository`.


=== Enrichment

Enrichment is the process to enrich the view of the graph with additional information, usually used when the enriched data is expensive to load/calculate, e.g. load node data or calculate the status.

Due to performance considerations, enrichment only works on the view of a graph and cannot be performed on the full graph.

==== Build in Enrichment

===== Node Enrichment

By default all vertices can be enriched with node information if _Node Enrichment_ is enabled.
To enable the enrichment of node information, the property `enrichment.resolveNodes` must be set to `true` on the graph.

Afterwards each vertex which either has a `nodeID (integer)` or `foreignSource (string)` and `foreignID (string)` property assigned will be enriched if a node with that information is found in the system.
A shorter version in form of `nodeCriteria=<foreignSource>:<foreignID>` is also available.

=== ReST API

The _Graph Service API_ provides a ReST API which is documented in detail link:#ga-development-rest-graph[here].

The Graph Service API ReST endpoints serializes the requested graph container, graph or view in json.
As the container and each element within that container may contain custom properties, the type of the property is not static.
This means, each `GraphContainerProvider` (or `GraphProvider`) can set properties on any element using a type which is only known by the domain the graph container is created in.
However when serializing this object as JSON it is not clear to the ReST endpoint how to do that.
In order to allow these values to be set as properties anyways, a custom `org.opennms.netmgt.graph.rest.api.PropertyConverter` can be exposed as an OSGi service.

=== Limitations

The following limitations are known for the _Graph Service API_:

- Status of vertices is not exposed
- custom images/icons cannot be set
- custom edge/vertex status providers are not implemented
- VMWare Topology Provider not fully migrated
- EnhancedLinkd Topology Provider not fully migrated
