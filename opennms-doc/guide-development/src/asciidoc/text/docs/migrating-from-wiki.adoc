[[gd-docs-migrating-from-wiki]]
=== Migrating content from project wiki
The https://wiki.opennms.org[project wiki] contains much information that ought to be migrated to the official documentation set.
To help with this effort, we have a wiki template which informs readers of articles that are tagged for migration to the official docs, or that have already been migrated.
When you identify an article in the OpenNMS wiki whose information should be migrated (either in its entirety, or just individual sections), use the following process.

1. If you do not already have a wiki account, https://wiki.opennms.org/wiki/Special:RequestAccount[request one] before getting started. Your request must be approved by a wiki admin. If you don't get approved within a day, send a note to the https://sourceforge.net/projects/opennms/lists/opennms-devel[opennms-devel mailing list] or on the https://chat.opennms.com/opennms/channels/opennms-development[*OpenNMS Development* chat channel].
2. Create an issue in the https://issues.opennms.org/projects/NMS/[project issue tracker, in project *NMS*]. Note the issue number; you will use it below.
3. After logging in to the wiki, visit the article whose content should be migrated.
4. Click on the *Edit Source* link at the top of the article view.
5. Add text like the following to the top of the article source editor:

[source]
----
{{OfficialDocs | scope=article | guide=admin | issue=NMS-9926 | date=March 2018 | completed=false}}
----

** The value of the `scope` attribute must be either `article`, if the entire article should be migrated,or `section` if only specific section(s) should be migrated.
*** When using `scope = section`, it's fine to use this template multiple times in a single article.
** The value of the `guide` attribute must be one of `admin`, `development`, `install`, or `user`.
*** If the information in an article should be migrated to multiple official guides, use multiple instances of the `{{OfficialDocs}}` template; try to target these by section when possible.
** The value of the `issue` parameter must be a valid issue ID in the https://issues.opennms.org[project issue tracker], and will become a live link
** The value of the `date` parameter should be the month and year when the tag was added, **e.g.** `March 2018`.
** The `completed` parameter is optional; it is assumed to be false if omitted, or true if its value is either `true` or `yes`.

8. Migrate the information, making sure to follow the guidelines laid out earlier in this section; do not just copy and paste, and watch out for obsolete information. If you need help, contact the developers through one of the methods mentioned above.
9. Once the migration is complete and the issue is closed, edit the wiki article again and change `completed=false` to `completed=true`.
10. The rendering of the template will change to indicate that the migration has been completed.

Adding the `{{OfficialDocs}}` template to an article will implicitly add that article to a pair of wiki categories:

* *Migration to official docs pending* or *Migration to official docs completed*, according to the value of the `completed` attribute
* *Migrate to `X` guide*, according to the value of the `guide` attribute
