This document is the guideline for people who wish to contribute to writing documentation for the OpenNMS project.
The OpenNMS software is free and open source, contribution of any kind is welcome.
We ask that you observe the rules and guidelines outlined here to maintain consistency across the project.

Each (sub)project is represented as a section of the documentation.
Each section will produce a HTML output in the file system that is generated in the `target/generated` sources folder.

The chosen file format for documentation is AsciiDoc (http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc[Asciidoc Homepage]).
Document files use the `.adoc` file extension.

Note that there are different ways to contribute documentation, each suitable for the different use cases:

* Tutorials and How To's should be published on the http://wiki.opennms.org[OpenNMS Wiki].
For example:
you want to describe how to use the Net-SNMP agent and the SNMP monitor from OpenNMS to solve a special use case with OpenNMS.

* The documentation in the source code should be formal technical documentation.
The writing style should be accurate and concise.
However, ensure that you explain concepts in detail and do not make omissions.
