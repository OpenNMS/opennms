=== Testing

This sections describes how developers can test features on the _Minion_ container.

==== Local Testing

You can compile, assemble, and spawn an interactive shell on the _Minion_ container using:

.Assemble and run the container in place
[source, bash]
----
cd features/minion && ./runInPlace.sh
----

==== System Tests

The runtime environment of the _Minion_ container and features differs greatly from those provided by the unit and integration tests.
For this reason, it is important to perform automated end-to-end testing of the features.

The system tests provide a framework which allows developers to instantiate a complete Docker-based _Minion_ system using a single _JUnit_ rule.

For further details, see the https://github.com/OpenNMS/minion-system-tests[minion-system-tests] project on Github.
