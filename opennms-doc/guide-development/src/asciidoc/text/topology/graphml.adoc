=== GraphML

In {opennms-product-name} the `GraphMLTopoloyProvider` uses http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/[GraphML] formatted files to visualize graphs.

[quote, , http://graphml.graphdrawing.org]
____
GraphML is a comprehensive and easy-to-use file format for graphs.
It consists of a language core to describe the structural properties of a graph and a flexible extension mechanism to add application-specific data.
 [...]
Unlike many other file formats for graphs, GraphML does not use a custom syntax.
Instead, it is based on XML and hence ideally suited as a common denominator for all kinds of services generating, archiving, or processing graphs.
____

{opennms-product-name} does not support the full feature set of GraphML.
The following features are not supported: Nested graphs, Hyperedges, Ports and Extensions.
For more information about GraphML refer to the http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/primer/graphml-primer.html[Official Documentation].

A basic graph definition using GraphML usually consists of the following GraphML elements:

 * Graph element to describe the graph
 * Key elements to define custom properties, each element in the GraphML document can define as data elements
 * Node and Edge elements
 * Data elements to define custom properties, which {opennms-product-name} will then interpret.

A very minimalistic example is given below:

[source, xml]
----
include::examples/minimalistic.xml[]
----
<1> The optional label of the menu entry.
<2> The graph definition.
<3> Each graph must have a namespace, otherwise {opennms-product-name} refuses to load the graph.
<4> Node definitions.

==== Create/Update/Delete GraphML Topology

In order to create a GraphML Topology, a valid GraphML xml file must exist.
Afterwards this is send to the {opennms-product-name} REST API to create it:

[source, shell]
----
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/xml" -u admin:admin -d@graph.xml 'http://localhost:8980/opennms/rest/graphml/topology-name'
----

The `topology-name` is a unique identifier for the Topology.
If a `label` property is defined for the Graphml element this is used to be displayed in the Topology UI, otherwise the `topology-name` defined here is used as a fallback.

To delete an already existing Topology a HTTP DELETE request must be send:

[source, shell]
----
curl -X DELETE -u admin:admin 'http://localhost:8980/opennms/rest/graphml/topology-name'
----

There is no PUT method available.
In order to update an existing GraphML Topology one must first delete and afterwards re-create it.

NOTE: Even if the HTTP Request was successful, it does not mean, that the Topology is actually loaded properly.
The HTTP Request states that the Graph was successfully received, persisted and is in a valid GraphML format.
However, the underlying `GraphMLTopologyProvider` may perform additional checks or encounters problems while parsing the file.
If the Topology does not show up, the `karaf.log` should be checked for any clues what went wrong.
In addition it may take a while before the Topology is actually selectable from the Topology UI.

==== Supported Attributes

A various set of GraphML attributes are supported and interpreted by {opennms-product-name} while reading the GraphML file.
The following table explains the supported attributes and for which GraphML elements they may be used.

[quote, , http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/primer/graphml-primer.html#Attributes]
____
The type of the GraphML-Attribute can be either boolean, int, long, float, double, or string.
These types are defined like the corresponding types in the Java(TM)-Programming language.

|=======================

[[gd-topology-graphml-focus-strategy]]
==== Focus Strategies

A `Focus Strategy` defines which Vertices should be added to focus when selecting the Topology.
The following strategies are available:

* *EMPTY* No Vertex is add to focus.
* *ALL* All Vertices are add to focus.
* *FIRST* The first Vertex is add to focus.
* *SPECIFIC* Only Vertices which id match the graph's property `focus-ids` are added to focus.

[[gd-topology-graphml-icons]]
==== Icons

With the _GraphMLTopoloygProvider_ it is not possible to change the icon from the Topology UI.
Instead if a custom icon should be used, each node must contain a `iconKey` property referencing an SVG element.

[[gd-topology-graphml-vertex-status-provider]]
==== Vertex Status Provider

The _Vertex Status Provider_ calculates the status of the Vertex.
There are multiple implementations available which can be configured for each graph: `default`, `script` and `propagate`.
If none is specified, there is no status provided at all.

===== Default Vertex Status Provider
The `default` status provider calculates the status based on the worst unacknowledged alarm associated with the Vertex's node.
In order to have a status calculated a ({opennms-product-name}) node must be associated with the Vertex.
This can be achieved by setting the GraphML attribute `nodeID` on the GraphML node accordingly.

===== Script Vertex Status Provider
The `script` status provider uses scripts similar to the <<gd-topology-graphml-edge-status-provider>>.
Just place Groovy scripts (with file extension .groovy) in the directory `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/graphml-vertex-status`.
All of the scripts will be evaluated and the most severe status will be used for the vertex in the topology's visualization.

If the script shouldn't contribute any status to a vertex just return `null`.

===== Propagate Vertex Status Provider
The `propagate` status provider follows all links from a node to its connected nodes.
It uses the status of these nodes to calculate the status by determining the worst one.

[[gd-topology-graphml-edge-status-provider]]
==== Edge Status Provider

It is also possible to compute a status for each edge in a given graph.
Just place Groovy scripts (with file extension .groovy) in the directory `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/graphml-edge-status`.
All of the scripts will be evaluated and the most severe status will be used for the edge in the topology's visualization.

The following simple Groovy script example will apply a different style and severity if the edge's associated source node is down.

.Scriptable edge status
[source, groovy]
----
import org.opennms.netmgt.model.OnmsSeverity;
import org.opennms.features.topology.plugins.topo.graphml.GraphMLEdgeStatus;

if ( sourceNode != null && sourceNode.isDown() ) {
    return new GraphMLEdgeStatus(OnmsSeverity.WARNING, [ 'stroke-dasharray' : '5,5', 'stroke' : 'yellow', 'stroke-width' : '6' ]);
} else {
    return new GraphMLEdgeStatus(OnmsSeverity.NORMAL, []);
}
----

If the script shouldn't contribute any status to an edge just return `null`.

[[gd-topology-graphml-layers]]
==== Layers

The _GraphMLTopologyProvider_ can handle GraphML files with multiple graphs.
Each Graph is represented as a Layer in the Topology UI.
If a vertex from one graph has an edge pointing to another graph, one can navigate to that layer.

.GraphML example defining multiple layers
[source, xml]
----
include::examples/layers.xml[]
----

[[gd-topology-graphml-breadcrumbs]]
==== Breadcrumbs

When multiple Layers are used it is possible to navigate between them (`navigate to` option from vertex' context menu).
To give the user some orientation breadcrumbs can be enabled with the `breadcrumb-strategy` property.

The following strategies are supported:

 * *NONE* No breadcrumbs are shown.
 * *SHORTEST_PATH_TO_ROOT* generates breadcrumbs from all visible vertices to the root layer (TopologyProvider).
    The algorithms assumes a hierarchical graph. Be aware, that all vertices MUST share the same root layer, otherwise the algorithm to determine the path to root does not work.

The following figure visualizes a graphml defining multiple layers (see below for the graphml definition).

image::topology/layers-example.jpg[]

From the given example, the user can select the `Breadcrumb Example` Topology Provider from the menu.
The user can switch between `Layer 1`, `Layer 2` and `Layer 3`.
In addition for each vertex which has connections to another layer, the user can select the `navigate to` option from the context menu of that vertex to navigate to the according layer.
The user can also search for all vertices and add it to focus.

The following behaviour is implemented:

 * If a user navigates from one vertex to a vertex in another layer, the view is switched to that layer and adds all vertices to focus, the `source vertex` pointed to. The Breadcrumb is `<parent layer name> > <source vertex>`.
 For example, if a user navigates from `Layer1:A2` to `Layer2:B1` the view switches to `Layer 2` and adds `B1` and `B2` to focus. In addition `Layer 1 > A2` is shown as Breadcrumbs.
 * If a user directly switches to another layer, the default focus strategy is applied, which may result in multiple vertices with no unique parent.
  The calculated breadcrumb is: `<parent layer name> > Multiple <target layer name>`.
  For example, if a user switches to `Layer 3`, all vertices of that layer are added to focus (`focus-strategy=ALL`). No unique path to root is found, the following breadcrumb is shown instead: `Layer 1 > Multiple Layer 1` > `Multiple Layer 2`
 * If a user adds a vertex to focus, which is not in the current selected layer, the view switches to that layer and only the "new" vertex is added to focus.
 The generated breadcrumb shows the path to root through all layers.
  For example, the user adds `C3` to focus, and the current layer is `Layer 1`, than the generated breadcrumb is as follows: `Layer 1 > A1 > B3`.
 * Only elements between layers are shown in the breadcrumb. Connections on the same layer are ignored.
 For example, a user adds `C5` to focus, the generated breadcrumb is as follows: `Layer 1 > A2 > B2`


The following graphml file defines the above shown graph.
Be aware, that the root vertex shown above is generated to help calculating the path to root.
It must not be defined in the graphml document.
