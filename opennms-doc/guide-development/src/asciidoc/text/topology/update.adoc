=== Topologies Updates

In {opennms-product-name} the `Kafka Producer` uses Topologies Updates to send topologies messages to Kafka.

Enhanced Linkd has six `OnmsTopologyUpdaters` each sending its own  NODES, BRIDGE, CDP, ISIS, LLDP and OSPF protocol `OnmsTopologyMessage`.

`Kafka Producer` implements an `OnmsTopologyConsumer` that reads the `OnmsTopologyMessage` to be shared over Kafka. 

The Topologies updates api are available under `opennms/features/topologies`

==== OnmsTopologyUpdater

To set up an implementation class of `OnmsTopologyUpdater` interface it must be implemented three methods:    

`OnmsTopology getTopology();`

`OnmsTopologyProtocol getProtocol() throws OnmsTopologyException;`

`String getName();`

An `OnmsTopologyUpdater` holds the `OnmsTopology` of the specified `OnmsTopologyProtocol`. 

In order to send `OnmsTopologyMessage` to subscribers the updater should register and send messages using the provided methods into `OnmsTopologyDao`

To register use:

`register(OnmsTopologyUpdater updater)`
Only one updater for protocol is allowed to register over `OnmsTopologyDao`.

To send messages to subscriber use: 

`void update(OnmsTopologyUpdater updater,OnmsTopologyMessage message) throws OnmsTopologyException;`

To unregister use:

`unregister(OnmsTopologyUpdater updater)`

Registering Updaters with OnmsTopologyDao will also provide Topology using `OnmsTopologyDao`

to get a Topology for a specific protocol use:

`OnmsTopology getTopology(String protocol)`

==== OnmsTopologyRef

`OnmsTopologyRef` is the topology basic interface. All topology defined objects are implementing it.

The methods defining OnmsTopolgyRef are:

The Id: a unique String identifier of the topology Object.

`String getId();`

The tool tip text: some additional information to describe the topology object.

`String getToolTipText();`

==== OnmsTopologyMessage

`OnmsTopologyMessage` is defined by `OnmsTopologyProtocol` by a `TopologyMessageStatus` and by an `OnmsTopologyRef` and it is send to all subscriber for the specified protocol by the registered updater via the
`OnmsTopologyDao' 

==== OnmsTopologyProtocol

`OnmsTopologyProtocol` represent a protocol. It is defined by a String but it is not case sensitive, CDP either cdp and Cdp will define the same protocol. 

An `OnmsTopologyUpdater` can be an updater for only one protocol.

An `OnmsTopologyConsumer` can be a consumer for several protocols.

==== TopologyMessageStatus

`TopologyMessageStatus` is an enum whose allowed values are: UPDATE or DELETE. 

UPDATE message means that the topology message holds information about an `OnmsTopologyRef` 
still available in Topology 

DELETE message means that the object `OnmsTopologyRef` has been deleted from topology.

==== OnmsTopology

A topology is made by vertices and edges  each of uniquely identified by an `OnmsTopologyRef`

`OnmsTopology` is a SET of `OnmsTopologyVertex` and a SET of `OnmsTopologyEdge`.

Also is possible to set and get a Default Vertex.

==== OnmsTopologyVertex

`OnmsTopologyVertex` implements `OnmsTopologyRef` and represents a vertex

==== OnmsTopologyEdge

`OnmsTopologyEdge` implements `OnmsTopologyRef` and represents an Edge and is made by a two `OnmsTopologyPort` the source and the target of the edge.

==== OnmsTopologyPort

`OnmsTopologyPort` implements `OnmsTopologyRef` represents a Port belonging to a Vertex so has a property to set and get the `OnmsTopologyVertex`.

The Port is an element of the Topology because it belongs to an Edge and is the connection element.

Two vertices are connected by an Edge by the corresponding Port.

==== OnmsTopologyConsumer

To set up an implementation class of `OnmsTopologyConsumer` interface it must be implemented three methods:

`String getName();`

`Set<OnmsTopologyProtocol> getProtocols();`

`void consume(OnmsTopologyMessage message);`

An `OnmsTopologyconsumer` consume the `OnmsTopologyMessage` of the specified list `OnmsTopologyProtocol` provided by the `getProtocols()` method implementing the method `void consume(OnmsTopologyMessage message)`

In order to receive `OnmsTopologyMessage` from the registered "Updaters", the "Consumer" should subscribe `OnmsTopologyDao` 

To subscribe use:

`void subscribe(OnmsTopologyConsumer consumer)`

To unsubscribe use:

`void unsubscribe(OnmsTopologyConsumer consumer)`
