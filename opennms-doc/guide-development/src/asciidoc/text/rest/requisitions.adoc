==== Requisitions

_RESTful_ service to the OpenNMS Provisioning Requisitions.
In this _API_, these "groups" of nodes are aptly named and treated as requisitions.

This current implementation supports _CRUD_ operations for managing provisioning requisitions.
Requisitions are first _POSTed_ and no provisioning (import/synchronize) operations are taken.
This is done so that a) the _XML_ can be verified and b) so that the operations can happen at a later time.
They are moved to the deployed state (put in the active requisition repository) when an import is run.

If a request says that it gets the _active_ requisition, that means it returns the pending requisition (being edited for deployment) if there is one, otherwise it returns the deployed requisition.
Note that anything that says it _adds/deletes/modifies_ a _node_, _interface_, etc. in these instructions is referring to modifying that element from the _requisition_ not from the database itself.
That will happen upon import/synchronization.

You may write requisition data if the authenticated user is in the _provision_, _rest_, or _admin_ roles.

| `/requisitions/{name}/nodes/{foreignId}/interfaces`                      | Adds (or replaces) an interface for the given node in the specified requisition.
| `/requisitions/{name}/nodes/{foreignId}/interfaces/{ipAddress}/services` | Adds (or replaces) a service on the given interface in the specified requisition.

| `/requisitions/{name}/import`                                   | Performs an import/synchronize on the specified foreign source. This turns the "active" requisition into the "deployed" requisition.
| `/requisitions/{name}/import?rescanExisting=false`              | Performs an import/synchronize on the specified foreign source. This turns the "active" requisition into the "deployed" requisition. Existing nodes will not be scanned until the next rescan interval, only newly-added nodes will be. Useful if you're planning on making a series of changes.
| `/requisitions/{name}`                                          | Update the specified foreign source.
