Note: the default offset is 0, the default limit is 10 results.  To get all results, use limit=0 as a parameter on the URL (ie, GET /nodes?limit=0).

Additionally, anywhere you use "id" in the queries below, you can use the foreign source and foreign ID separated by a colon instead (ie, GET /nodes/fs:fid).
