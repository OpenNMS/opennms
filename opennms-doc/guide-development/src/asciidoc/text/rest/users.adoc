==== Users

Since users are not currently stored in the database, the ReST interface for them is not as full-fledged as that of nodes, etc.

IMPORTANT: You cannot use hibernate criteria for filtering.
You may need to touch the `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/users.xml` file on the filesystem for any addition or modification actions to take effect (see link:http://jira.opennms.org/browse/NMS-6469[NMS-6469] for details).
