A RESTful interface is a web service conforming to the REST architectural style as described in the book link:http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529260[RESTful Web Services].
This page is describes the RESTful interface for {opennms-product-name}.

=== ReST URL

The base URL for Rest Calls is: http://opennmsserver:8980/opennms/rest/

For instance, http://localhost:8980/opennms/rest/alarms/ will give you the current alarms in the system.

=== Authentication

Use HTTP Basic authentication to provide a valid username and password.
By default you will not receive a challenge, so you must configure your ReST client library to send basic authentication proactively.

=== Data format

Jersey allows ReST calls to be made using either XML or JSON.
By default a request to the API is returned in XML.
To get JSON encoded responses one has to send the following header with the request: `Accept: application/json`.

=== Standard Parameters

The following are standard params which are available on most resources (noted below)

.ReST standard parameter for resources
[options="header", cols="1,10"]
|===
| Parameter   | Description
| `limit`     | integer, limiting the number of results. This is particularly handy on events and notifications, where an accidental call with no limit could result in many thousands of results being returned, killing either the client or the server. If set to 0, then no limit applied
| `offset`    | integer, being the numeric offset into the result set from which results should start being returned. E.g., if there are 100 result entries, offset is 15, and limit is 10, then entries 15-24 will be returned. Used for pagination
2+| *Filtering*: All properties of the entity being accessed can be specified as parameters in either the _URL_ (for _GET_) or the form value (for _PUT_ and _POST_). If so, the value will be used to add a filter to the result. By default, the operation is equality, unless the `comparator` parameter is sent, in which case it applies to *all* comparisons in the filter. Multiple properties will result in an `AND` operation between the filter elements. Available comparators are:
| `eq`        | Checks for equality
| `ne`        | Checks for non-equality
| `ilike`     | Case-insensitive wildcarding (`%` is the wildcard)
| `like`      | Case-sensitive wildcarding (`%` is the wildcard)
| `gt`        | Greater than
| `lt`        | Less than
| `ge`        | Greater than or equal
| `le`        | Less than or equal
|===

If the value `null` is passed for a given property, then the obvious operation will occur (comparator will be ignored for that property).
`notnull` is handled similarly.

* _Ordering_: If the parameter `orderBy` is specified, results will be ordered by the named property.
Default is ascending, unless the `order` parameter is set to `desc` (any other value will default to ascending)

* _Raw where clause_:  If there is a `query` parameter, it will be used as a raw where clause (_SQL_, not _HQL_), and added to any other filters created by other parameters

=== Standard filter examples

Take `/events` as an example.

[options="header", cols="5,10"]
|===
| Resource                                                                           | Description
| `/events?eventUei=uei.opennms.org/internal/rtc/subscribe`                          | would return the first 10 events with the rtc subscribe UEI, (10 being the default limit for events)
| `/events?eventUei=uei.opennms.org/internal/rtc/subscribe&limit=0`                  | would return *all* the rtc subscribe events (potentially quite a few)
| `/events?id=100&comparator=gt`                                                     | would return the first 10 events with an id greater than 100
| `/events?eventAckTime=notnull`                                                     | would return the first 10 events that have a non-null Ack time (i.e. those that have been acknowledged)
| `/events?eventAckTime=notnull&id=100&comparator=gt&limit=20`                       | would return the first 20 events that have a non-null Ack time and an id greater than 100.  Note that the notnull value causes the comparator to be ignored for eventAckTime
| `/events?eventAckTime=2008-07-28T04:41:30.530%2B12:00&id=100&comparator=gt&limit=20` | would return the first 20 events that have were acknowledged after 28th July 2008 at 4:41am (+12:00), and an id greater than 100.  Note that the same comparator applies to both property comparisons. Also note that you must URL encode the plus sign when using GET.
| `/events?orderBy=id&order=desc`                                                    | would return the 10 latest events inserted (probably, unless you've been messing with the id's)
|===

=== HTTP Return Codes

The following apply for OpenNMS Horizon 18 and newer.

* All the DELETE requests are going to return a 204 (NO_CONTENT) on success.
* All the PUT requests are going to return a 204 (NO_CONTENT) on success.
* All the POST requests that can either add or update an entity are going to return a 204 (NO_CONTENT) on success.
* All the POST associated to resource addition are going to return a 201 (CREATED) on success.
* All the POST requests where it is required to return an object will return a 200 (OK).
* All the requests excepts GET for the Requisitions end-point and the Foreign Sources Definitions end-point will return 202 (ACCEPTED). This is because all the requests are actually executed asynchronously and there is no way to know the status of the execution, or wait until the processing is done.
* If a resource is not modified during a PUT request, a NOT_MODIFIED will be returned. A NO_CONTENT will be returned only on a success operation.
* All GET requests are going to return 200 (OK) on success.
* All GET requests are going to return 404 (NOT_FOUND) when a single resource doesn't exist; but will return 400 (BAD_REQUEST), if an intermediate resource doesn't exist. For example, if a specific IP doesn't exist on a valid node, return 404. But, if the IP is valid and the node is not valid, because the node is an intermediate resource, a 400 will be returned.
* If something not expected is received from the Service/DAO Layer when processing any HTTP request, like an exception, a 500 (INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR) will be returned.
* Any problem related with the incoming parameters, like validations, will generate a 400 (BAD_REQUEST).

=== Identifying Resources

Some endpoints deal in resources, which are identified by _Resource IDs_.
Since every resource is ultimately parented under some node, identifying the node which contains a resource is the first step in constructing a resource ID.
Two styles are available for identifying the node in a resource ID:

[options="header", cols="5,10,10"]
|===
| Style            | Description                                                                           | Example
| `node[ID]`       | Identifies a node by its database ID, which is always an integer                      | `node[42]`
| `node[FS:FID]`   | Identifies a node by its foreign-source name and foreign-ID, joined by a single colon | `node[Servers:115da833-0957-4471-b496-a731928c27dd]`
|===

The node identifier is followed by a period, then a resource-type name and instance name.
The instance name's characteristics may vary from one resource-type to the next.
A few examples:

[options="header", cols="5,10"]
|===
| Value                              | Description
| `nodeSnmp[]`                       | Node-level (scalar) performance data for the node in question.
                                       This type is the only one where the instance identifier is empty.
| `interfaceSnmp[eth0-04013f75f101]` | A layer-two interface as represented by a row in the SNMP `ifTable`.
                                       The instance identifier is composed of the interface's `ifName` and its `ifPhysAddress` (if it has one).
| `dskIndex[_root_fs]`               | The root filesystem of a node running the Net-SNMP management agent.
|===

Putting it all together, here are a few well-formed resource IDs:

* `node[1].nodeSnmp[]`
* `node[42].interfaceSnmp[eth0-04013f75f101]`
* `node[Servers:115da833-0957-4471-b496-a731928c27dd].dskIndex[_root_fs]`
