==== Foreign Sources

ReSTful service to the {opennms-product-name} Provisioning Foreign Source definitions.  Foreign source definitions are used to control the scanning (service detection) of services for SLA monitoring as well as the data collection settings for physical interfaces (resources).

This API supports CRUD operations for managing the Provisioner's foreign source definitions. Foreign source definitions are POSTed and will be deployed when the corresponding requisition gets imported/synchronized by Provisiond.

If a request says that it gets the "active" foreign source, that means it returns the pending foreign source (being edited for deployment) if there is one, otherwise it returns the deployed foreign source.
