==== Flow API

The _Flow API_ can be used to retrieve summary statistics and time series data derived from persisted flows.

NOTE: Unless specific otherwise, all unit of time are expressed in milliseconds.

All of the endpoints support the following query string parameters to help filter the results:


NOTE: The given filters are combined using a logical `AND`.
There is no support for using `OR` logic, or combinations thereof.


|===
| name               | default   | comment
| start              | -14400000 | Timestamp in milliseconds.

                                   If > 0, the timestamp is relative to the UNIX epoch (January 1st 1970 00:00:00 AM).

                                   If < 0, the timestamp is relative to the `end` option (i.e.: default value is 4 hours ago).
| end                | 0         | Timestamp in milliseconds. If \<= 0, the effective value will be the current timestamp.
| ifIndex            | (none)    | Filter for flows that came in through the given SNMP interface.
| exporterNode       | (none)    | Filter for flows that came where exported by the given node.

                                   Support either node id (integer) i.e. 1, or foreign source and foreign id lookups i.e. FS:FID.
|===

The `exporters` endpoints do not support any parameters.

The `applications/enumerate` endpoint also supports:

[options="header"]
|===
| name               | default   | comment
| limit              | 10        | Number of applications with flows to return
| prefix             | ""        | If provided, filters the results to only include applications with names that start
                                   with the given prefix (using fuzzy matching)
|===

The `applications` and `applications/series` endpoints also support:

[options="header"]
|===
| name               | default   | comment
| N                  | none      | Number of top entries (determined by total bytes transferred) to return
| includeOther       | false     | When set to `true` the results will also include an additional row or column that contains
                                   the bytes transferred for the flows that fall outside of the selected set
| application        | none      | If provided, returns only flow series that match the given application(s). This field
                                   can be repeated for any number of applications to be included in the query.
|===

Both endpoints require one of `N` or `application` query parameters to be set and will return an error if neither or
both are set.

The `conversations/enumerate` endpoint also supports:

[options="header"]
|===
| name               | default   | comment
| limit              | 10        | Number of hosts with flows to return
| location           | ".*"        | If provided, filters the results to only include conversations matching the given
location regex pattern
| protocol           | ".*"        | If provided, filters the results to only include conversations matching the given
protocol regex pattern
| lower              | ".*"        | If provided, filters the results to only include conversations matching the given
lower IP address regex pattern
| upper              | ".*"        | If provided, filters the results to only include conversations matching the given
upper IP address regex pattern
| application        | ".*"        | If provided, filters the results to only include conversations matching the given
application regex pattern
|===

The `conversations` and `conversations/series` endpoints also supports:

[options="header"]
|===
| name               | default   | comment
| N                  | 10        | Number of top entries (determined by total bytes transferred) to return
| includeOther       | false     | When set to `true` the results will also include an additional row or column that contains
                                   the bytes transferred for the flows that fall outside of selected set.
| conversation       | none      | If provided, returns only flow series that match the given conversation(s). This field
                                   can be repeated for any number of conversations to be included in the query.
|===

NOTE: Make sure to URL encode the conversation value in your request.

Both endpoints requires one of `N` or `conversation` query parameters to be set and will return an error if neither or
both are set.

The `converstations/series` endpoint also supports:

[options="header"]
|===
| name               | default   | comment
| step               | 300000    | Requested time interval between rows.
|===

The `hosts/enumerate` endpoint also supports:

[options="header"]
|===
| name               | default   | comment
| limit              | 10        | Number of hosts with flows to return
| pattern            | ".*"        | If provided, filters the results to only include hosts with names that match the given
regex pattern
|===

The `hosts` and `hosts/series` endpoints also support:

[options="header"]
|===
| name               | default   | comment
| N                  | none      | Number of top entries (determined by total bytes transferred) to return
| includeOther       | false     | When set to `true` the results will also include an additional row or column that contains
                                   the bytes transferred for the flows that fall outside of the selected set.
| host               | none      | If provided, returns only flow series that match the given host(s). This field
                                   can be repeated for any number of hosts to be included in the query.
|===

Both endpoints requires one of `N` or `host` query parameters to be set and will return an error if neither or
both are set.
