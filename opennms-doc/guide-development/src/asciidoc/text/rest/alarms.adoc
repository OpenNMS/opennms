==== Alarms
NOTE: the default offset is 0, the default limit is 10 results. To get all results, use `limit=0` as a parameter on the URL (ie, `GET /events?limit=0`).

[options="header", cols="5,10"]

| `/alarms?x=y&...&ack=''(true;false)''` | Acknowledges (or unacknowledges) alarms matching the additional query parameters. eg, `/alarms?node.id=4&ack=true`

===== New in OpenNMS 1.11.0

In OpenNMS 1.11.0, some additional features are supported in the alarm ack API:

[options="header", cols="5,10"]
|===
| Resource                        | Description
| `/alarms/{id}?clear=true`       | Clears an alarm.
| `/alarms/{id}?escalate=true`    | Escalates an alarm. eg, NORMAL -> MINOR, MAJOR -> CRITICAL, etc.
| `/alarms?x=y&...&clear=true`    | Clears alarms matching the additional query parameters.
| `/alarms?x=y&...&escalate=true` | Escalates alarms matching the additional query parameters.
|===

Additionally, when acknowledging alarms (ack=true) you can now specify an `ackUser` parameter.
You will only be allowed to `ack` as a different user IF you are PUTting as an authenticated user who is in the _admin_ role.
