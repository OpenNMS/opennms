=== Event Forwarder

The event forwarder listens for _all_ events on the internal event bus of {opennms-product-name}.
Events from the bus are sent to a Camel processor, which can filter or transform these, before being sent to the AMQP endpoint.

The event forwarer exposes the following properties via the `org.opennms.features.amqp.eventforwarder` pid:

[options="header"]
|===
| Property      | Default                                                         | Description
| connectionUrl | amqp://guest:guest@onms/test?brokerlist=\'tcp://127.0.0.1:5672' | Used by the AMQPConnectionFactory. See http://people.apache.org/~grkvlt/qpid-site/qpid-java/qpid-client/apidocs/org/apache/qpid/jms/ConnectionURL.html[ConnectionURL]
 for a full list of options.
| destination   | amqp:OpenNMS-Exchange/opennms-routing-key  | Target queue or topic. See http://camel.apache.org/amqp.html[AMQP] for details.
| processorName | default-event-forwarder-processor          | Name `org.apache.camel.Processor` used to filter and/or format the events.
|===

The default processor, the `default-event-forwarder-processor`, marshalls events to XML and does not perform any filtering.
This means that when enabled, all events will be forwarded to the AMQP destination with XML strings as the message body.

==== Setup

Start by logging into a Karaf shell.

Update the properties with your deployment specific values:

[source]

config:property-set destination amqp:OpenNMS-Exchange/opennms-routing-key
config:property-set processorName default-event-forwarder-processor
config:update
----

Install the feature:

[source]
----
feature:install opennms-amqp-event-forwarder
