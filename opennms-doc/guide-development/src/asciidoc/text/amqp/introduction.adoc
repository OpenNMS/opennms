The AMQP Integration allows external systems to communicate with the event bus of {opennms-product-name} and receive alarms via the AMQP protocol.

NOTE: _AMQP_ is standard messaging protocol supported by a number of brokers including _ActiveMQ_ and _QPID_.

The integration is written using Camel + OSGi and has the following components:

* Event Forwarder
* Event Receiver
* Alarm Northbounder

Custom filtering (i.e. which events to forward) and transformations (i.e. how the events are represented in the messages) can be used in each of the components.
Generic implementations

The integration is written using Camel + OSGi and exposes interfaces through which events and alarms can be filtered and/or transformed.
The features are described in detail bellow.


NOTE: Each componenent can be configured and setup independently, i.e. you can choose to only forward alarms.
