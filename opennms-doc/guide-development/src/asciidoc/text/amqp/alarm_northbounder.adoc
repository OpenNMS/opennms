=== Alarm Northbounder

The alarm northbounder listens for _all_ northbound alarms.
Alarms are sent to a Camel processor, which can filter or transform these, before being sent to the AMQP endpoint.

The alarm northbounder exposes the following properties via the `org.opennms.features.amqp.alarmnorthbounder` pid:

[options="header"]
|===
| Property        | Default                                  | Description
| connectionUrl   | amqp://localhost:5672                    | Used by the JmsConnectionFactory. See http://camel.apache.org/amqp.html[AMQP] for details.
| username        | guest                                    | Username
| password        | guest                                    | Password
| destination     | amqp:topic:opennms-alarms                | Target queue or topic. See http://camel.apache.org/amqp.html[AMQP] for details.
| processorName   | default-alarm-northbounder-processor     | Named `org.apache.camel.Processor` implementation used to filter and/or format the alarms.
|===

The default processor, the `default-alarm-northbounder-processor`, converts the alarms to a string and does not perform any filtering.
This means that when enabled, all alarms will be forwarded to the AMQP destination with strings as the message body.
