=== Alarm Northbounder

The alarm northbounder listens for _all_ northbound alarms.
Alarms are sent to a Camel processor, which can filter or transform these, before being sent to the AMQP endpoint.

The alarm northbounder exposes the following properties via the `org.opennms.features.amqp.alarmnorthbounder` pid:

[options="header"]
|===
| Property        | Default                                                           | Description
| _connectionUrl_ | `amqp://guest:guest@onms/test?brokerlist=\'tcp://127.0.0.1:5672'` | Used by the AMQPConnectionFactory.
                                                                                        See http://people.apache.org/~grkvlt/qpid-site/qpid-java/qpid-client/apidocs/org/apache/qpid/jms/ConnectionURL.html[ConnectionURL] for a full list of options.
| _destination_   | `amqp:OpenNMS-Exchange/opennms-routing-key`                       | Target queue or topic.
                                                                                        See http://camel.apache.org/amqp.html[AMQP] for details.
| _processorName_ | `default-alarm-northbounder-processor`                            | Name `org.apache.camel.Processor` used to filter and/or format the events.
|===

The default processor, the `default-alarm-northbounder-processor`, converts the alarms to a string and does not perform any filtering.
This means that when enabled, all alarms will be forwarded to the AMQP destination with strings as the message body.

==== Setup

Start by logging into a Karaf shell.
