[OpenNMS][]
===========

[OpenNMS][] is the world's first enterprise grade network management application platform developed under the open source model.

Well, what does that mean?

*	World's First

	The OpenNMS Project was started in July of 1999 and registered on SourceForge in March of 2000. It has years of experience on the alternatives.

*	Enterprise Grade

	It was designed from "day one" to monitor tens of thousands to ultimately unlimited devices with a single instance. It brings the power, scalability and flexibility that enterprises and carriers demand.

*	Application Platform

	While OpenNMS is useful "out of the box," it is designed to be highly customizable to create an unique and integrated management solution.

* Open Source

	OpenNMS is 100% Free and Open Source software, with no license fees, software subscriptions or special "enterprise" versions.

Before making a pull request, please submit an [OCA][] for copyright assignment.  Note that this does **not** mean that you are giving up your copyright of your changes to OpenNMS, it instead allows for _dual_ copyright over contributed code.

Also, it is recommended that you make your changes in master and make a pull request there, not in one of the release (eg. 1.12 or 1.10) branches.  Fixes can be cherry-picked back to a stable branch, but we try to keep churn out of the stable releases if possible.

If you are using Eclipse, please read the [Eclipse][] page for details on setting up your workspace for code conventions and the plugins we use.
