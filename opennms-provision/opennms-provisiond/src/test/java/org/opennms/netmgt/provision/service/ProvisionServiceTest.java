    *  A list of use cases/todos for a Provision Service
    * - provide a set of scanners to be called
    * - configure the scanners per foreign source
    * - be able to 'merge' scan results and 'import' data
    * - need to be able to scan for each type of resource
    * - need a layer that takes the 'change set' and then persists it including sending events
    * - how do I track how to call the various scanners...
    *   - some are per interface (e.g. service scanner)
    *   - some are per node (e.g. service scanner)
    *   - some run once (ie per node) but update data many resources (eg interfaces)
    *   - some just look at interface attributes and update
    * - what do I do about scanners that want to lookup information from the database...
    *   - how do I deal with the transactions?
    * - I could have scan phases - some that collect and then others that update
    * - it would be nice to be able to 'merge' all of the snmpdata that needs to be
    *     collected into a single walker for efficiency
    * - how do I know about SNMP enabled and the Preferred SNMP interface etc.
    *
    */

    /*
    *  IDEAS:
    *  - a multiphase scanner (are phases configurable?)
    *  - a phase for collecting data and a phase for updating data (maybe pre and post update?)
    *  - maybe provide 'triggers' for each kind of resource added and be able to associate
    *      a scanner with a trigger
    *  - as far as 'provided' data vs 'discovered' data we could have wrappers that prevent
    *    the data that should 'win'
    *  - maybe a phase for 'agent' detection
    *
    */

    /*
    *  Notes about current Importer Phases:
    * 1. parse spec file and build node representation based on data from file
    *
    * 2. diff spec file nodelist with current node list to find
    *  A. nodes that have disappeared from spec file
    *  B. nodes that have only just appeared in spec file
    *  C. the remaining nodes
    *
    * 3. Delete all nodes in group A from Database
    *
    * 4. for each node in group C
    *
    *     A. 'preprocess' == gatherAdditionalData == get SNMP data
    *     B. 'persist' == store spec file data + gathered data to db
    *
    * 5. for each node in group B
    *     A. 'preprocess'
    *     B. 'persist'
    *
    * 6. for each node in group B or C
    *     A. 'relate' set the parent node to a reference to the appropriate node

    *  Phase Ideas
    * 1. agent scan phase
    * 2. phase for
    *
    * I had the idea that we should have the scanners define new resources and then
    * rework the collector to collect data for the resources that exist.
    *
    * We can do scanners in multiple protocols SNMP, WMI, NRPE/NsClient, others?
    *
    * Two possible ideas related to this:
    *   1. We can make the scanners be responsible for finding not the collectors.
    *   2. We could have a service that would allow the collector to push a scan
    *      through when it collected the data.
    *   Neither of these are perfect.  It may be that the scanning and collection
    *     are just variations of the same theme
    *
    */

    /*
    * More Ideas:
    *
    * Class are created that represent Scanners...
    *
    * The Scanners use the ScanProvider annotation
    * Scopes can be 'Network/ImportSet', 'Node', 'Agent' or 'Resource'
    *  - agent and resource provide a type indicator
    * A ScanProvider has a 'Lifetime' that matches one of the Scopes
    * The ScanProviders have methods that define a Scope and a Phase.
    * The methods are called for each element at the appropriate scope
    *
    * possible phase list for a single node
    *
    * - triggerValidation
    * - network comparison
    * - defunct node deletion
    * - agentDetection -
    * - resourceDiscovery - scope Agent (calls Scope network, then node for each node, then agent for matching agents)
    * - resourceScan - scope Resource (calls networ,
    * - persist - scope Node
    */

    /*
    * We need to define idea of a life cycle.  A lifecycle would define a set of phases
    * that it would go through.  Each phase could be a single call or a pile of calls executed
    * in an ExecutorService.  This would be up to the phase.
    *
    * Lifecycles would be triggered by various events.
    * 1.  New Suspect would trigger a Node Scanning Lifecyle
    * 2.  Rescan would trigger a Node Scanning Lifecycle
    * 3.  Import would trigger an Import Lifecycle
    * 4.  There may be other lifecycles like resource discovered on collection
    * 5.  Maybe Collection itself could use this Lifecycle model
    *
    * Lifecycle phases could contain embedded Lifecycles.  For example the Import lifecycle
    * would embed a Node Scanning Lifecycle for each node being inserted or updated.
    *
    * We need a way to define input and output of a phase...
    *
    * Maybe the argument and the return value of a 'scanMethod'
    *
    * Also need an indication of where transactions should live
