      <h3>Vulnerability Scanning</h3>

      <p>
        Vulnerability scanning finds <em>system vulnerabilities</em>
        that can be exploited by harmful network traffic. This harmful traffic
        can be generated by intruders to gain access to restricted information, alter the
        flow of data through your network, or even disable important services on your network.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vulnerability scanning provides the following information about your network devices:
        <ul>
          <li>Detection and diagnosis of open vulnerabilities</li>
          <li>Deep detection of all open ports and services</li>
          <li>Logging of all available information that may benefit intruders</li>
          <li>Detection of passwords that are set to default or easy-to-guess values</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        With this information, you can take steps to make your network more secure from
        network-based intrusion:
        <ul>
          <li>Apply patches and software updates to fix known security holes</li>
          <li>Shut down unwanted or unnecessary services</li>
          <li>Remove access to sensitive information on your network</li>
          <li>Change security settings and passwords to make them more difficult to crack</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Open vulnerabilities are issues that have been detected by the scanning process and
        currently affect the target address. When a vulnerability has been fixed, the scanning
        process will confirm that the vulnerability no longer exists and resolve it
        automatically.
      </p>

      <p>
        The vulnerability scanning process can be performed at Scan Levels 1 through 4.
        The higher the scan level, the more invasive the scan will be to the target
        IP address. Use caution when performing scans with Scan Level 3 and 4; although
        the information they provide may be more accurate and comprehensive, they can also expose the
        target machines to dangerous exploits that may cause data loss or denial of
        services. Scan levels can only be changed by an administrator.
