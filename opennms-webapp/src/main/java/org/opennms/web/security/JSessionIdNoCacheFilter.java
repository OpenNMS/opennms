/** Sets the header "cache-control: no-cache" if the response contains the jsessionid. This is done for security reasons;
 * Web servers use session cookies to identify the active user sessions.  Disclosing these session cookies to an
 * attacker can result in a session hijacking attack. With this in mind, session cookies should be treated as sensitive
 * data and should be well protected. With a secure cache-control policy in place, session cookies are typically stored
 * in the browser memory instead of flushed to the hard drive. When a browsing session is terminated, the corresponding
 * session cookies are deleted from the client machine.  However, session cookies can also be kept in a cached web page.
 * For example, when a user login in a web site, the returned web page may contain session cookies in the “set-cookie”
 * response headers.  If the “cache-control” header in this page is defined as “public”, all proxy servers and gateways
 * between the client and server are allowed to cache this page. Thus, the risk of exposing these sensitive session
 * cookies to an attacker is significantly increased. It’s recommended to change the cache-control header to secure
 * values, e.g., no-cache.    Similar to a password, if an attacker steals the session cookies that represent a valid
 * user session, they can then use them to masquerade as victim users and access their personal data. If a victim user
 * has administrative privileges, then the security of entire web site is at risk.
