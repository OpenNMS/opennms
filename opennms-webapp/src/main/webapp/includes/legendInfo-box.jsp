<h2>
<p>
Each status cell is an intersection of a Location and Application
</p>
<p>
An Application is defined by a subset of the set of IP based services created in OpenNMS
</p>
<p>
A Location is an arbitrary entity defined through configuration by the OpenNMS user
</p>
<p>
Each Location presents Availability as the best percentage possible based on the history of status<br/>
of services monitored from <b>all</b> remote pollers in that Location since midnight of the current day.<br/>
If there were 2 services being monitored by 2 remote pollers and each 1 service down, uniquely, then<br/>
 the availability would still be 100%.
</p>
<p>
Each Location presents Status as the worst known status of all remote pollers in a Started state.
