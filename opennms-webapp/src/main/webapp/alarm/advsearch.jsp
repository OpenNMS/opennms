      <h3>Searching Instructions</h3>

      <p>The <strong>Advanced Alarm Search</strong> page can be used to search the alarm list on
      multiple fields. Fill in values for each field that you wish to use to narrow down
      the search.</p>

      <p>To select alarms by time, first check the box for the time range
      that you wish to limit and then fill out the time in the boxes provided.</p>

      <p>If you wish to select alarms within a specific time span, check <em>both</em>
      boxes and enter the beginning and end of the range in the boxes provided.</p>
