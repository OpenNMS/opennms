## Filing an issue

Before filing an issue, please [search the queue](https://github.com/masayuki0812/c3/issues) to make sure it hasn't already been reported.

If a bug, please include the following â€”

1. What version of C3?
1. What browsers have you confirmed it in?
1. Can you isolate the issue by providing a jsFiddle demonstrating it in a minimalist capacity?

Please *do not* ask for support using the issue queue. For support, please ask [on chat](https://gitter.im/masayuki0812/c3) or [the mailing list](groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/c3js).

##Building C3 from sources

 1. **Clone the repo from GitHub**

        git clone https://github.com/masayuki0812/c3.git
        cd c3

 2. **Acquire build dependencies.** Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed on your workstation. This is only needed to _build_ C3 from sources. C3 itself has no dependency on Node.js once it is built. Now run:

        npm install -g grunt-cli
        npm install

    The first `npm` command sets up the popular [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) build tool. You might need to run this command with `sudo` if you're on Linux or Mac OS X, or in an Administrator command prompt on Windows. The second `npm` command fetches the remaining build dependencies.

 3. **Run the build tool**

        grunt

    Now you'll find the built files in `c3.js`, `c3.min.js`, `c3.css` & `c3.min.css`.

## Running the tests
The `grunt` script will automatically run the specification suite and report its results.

Or, if you want to run the specs in a browser (e.g., for debugging), simply open `spec/runner.html` in your browser.

## Contributing your changes

Add something about PRs here, indicate that PRs should not bump the version number & the build output files (`c3.js`, `c3.min.js`, `c3.css` & `c3.min.css`) should be excluded
