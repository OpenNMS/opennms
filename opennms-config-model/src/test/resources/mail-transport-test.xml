<!--  Example end2end test sending to localhost and reading from gmail.  In an
      end2end test, mail is sent to the specified host and read from the specified host.
      If the host value is set to ${ipaddr}, then the IP address of the service being
      polled will be used.  And end2end test is configured when both a send and a read
      test are defined.  The subject in the send is used for the match and the subject is
      modified to have the current time in millis appended.  The subject-match attribute in
      the read test is ignored for the end2end test.-->
