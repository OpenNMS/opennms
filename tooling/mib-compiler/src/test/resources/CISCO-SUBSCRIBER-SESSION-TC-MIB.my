SubSessionType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "An enumerated integer-value describing the type of subscriber
        session.  This value has the intent of refining the interface
        type assigned to a subscriber session.  The interface type
        assigned to a subscriber session groups those types of
        subscriber sessions with similar interface semantics.

        A PPP subscriber session consists of a PPP connection
        (RFC-1661)
        and has an interface type of 'ppp'.  The following subscriber
        types refine PPP subscriber sessions:

            'pppSubscriber'
                A PPP connection initiated over a circuit (e.g., an
        ISDN
                line or ATM VC) using the LCP (RFC-1661).

            'pppoeSubscriber'
                A PPP connection over Ethernet (RFC-2516), initiated
                by a PADI (PPPoE Active Discovery Initiation) packet.

            'l2tpSubscriber'
                A PPP connection over an L2TP tunnel (RFC-2661),
                initiated by an Incoming-Call-Request control message.

            'l2fSubscriber'
                A PPP connection over an L2F tunnel (RFC-2341),
                initiated by a L2F_OPEN message with a non-zero MID.

        An IP subscriber session consists of the routed traffic
        associated with a subscriber IP address having an interface
        type of 'ipSubscriber'.  Routed traffic describes IP traffic
        that transits at least one router.  If a subscriber's IP
        address
        is not unique to the system, further distinguishing
        characteristics, such as VRF or MAC address, form part of the
        subscriber's identity.  The following subscriber types refine
        IP
        subscriber sessions:

            'ipInterfaceSubscriber'
                An IP subcriber session provisioned by the system's
                configuration which consists of all traffic received by
                the interface to which the provisioning applies.

            'ipPktSubscriber'
                An IP subscriber session initiated by the receipt of
        the
                first packet received with an unclassified source IP
                address.

            'ipDhcpv4Subscriber'
                An IP subscriber session initiated by the receipt of a
                DHCPv4 DISCOVER packet (RFC-2131).

            'ipRadiusSubscriber'
                An IP subscriber session initiated by the receipt of a
                RADIUS Access-Request packet (RFC-2865).

        An L2 subscriber session consists of the non-routed traffic
        associated with a subscriber IP address having an interface
        type of 'l2Subscriber'.  Non-routed traffic describes IP
        traffic
        that doesn't transit a router, meaning that the subscriber must
        be directly connected to the system or have a connection
        through
        an L2 access network (e.g., bridges, switches, and tunnels).
        The
        following subscriber types refine L2 subscriber sessions:

            'l2MacPacketSubscriber'
                An L2 subscriber session initiated by the receipt of
        the
                first layer 2 packet with an unclassified source MAC
                address.

            'l2Dhcpv4Subscriber'
                An L2 subscriber session initiated by the receipt of a
                DHCPv4 DISCOVER packet (RFC-2131).

            'l2RadiusSucriber'
                An L2 subscriber session initiated by the receipt of a
                RADIUS Access-Request packet (RFC-2865).

        The system should assign the value 'other' to any subscriber
        session not recognized by the implementation of a MIB module
        using this textual convention.

        The value 'all' represents a special value used to indicate all
        subscriber session types.  For example, a scope of aggregation
        that includes all subscriber session types uses this value to
        indicate this fact."
