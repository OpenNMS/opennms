    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB module defines textual conventions describing
        subscriber session identities.  A subscriber session identity
        consists of data associated with a subscriber session serving as
        credentials used to determine authority, status, rights, or
        entitlement to privileges."

        "An enumerated integer-value describing a subscriber session
        identity:

            'other'
                The implementation of the MIB module using this textual
                convention does not recognize the subscriber session
                identity.

            'subscriberLabel'
                The arbitrary integer-value assigned by the system
                to uniquely identify the subscriber session within the
                scope of the system.

            'macAddress'
                The subscriber's MAC address.

            'nativeVrf'
                The name of the VRF on which the subscriber session
                originates.

                The IP address assigned to the subscriber session on
        the
                customer-facing side of the system.

            'domainVrf'
                The name of the VRF to which the system transfers the
                subscriber session traffic.

                The Port-Bundle Host Key (PBHK) uniquely identifying
        the
                subscriber session.  A PBHK consists of a source IP
                address and a TCP port number.

                The name identifying the circuit on the 'calling
                station', access multiplexor, or access switch that

                An octet string identifying the port on the Network
                Access Server (NAS) that provides access to the
                subscriber.

                The type of media providing access to the subscriber.

            'mlpNegotiated'

                using multi-link PPP negotiation.

            'protocol'
                The type of protocol providing access to the
        subscriber.

        message
                received from the subscriber.

SubscriberProtocolType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "An enumerated integer-value describing the type of protocol
        providing access to the subscriber:

            'other'
                The implementation of the MIB module using this textual
                convention does not recognize the type of protocol
                providing access to the subscriber.

            'atom'
                Any Transport over MPLS (AToM) provides access to the
                subscriber.

            'ip'
                The Internet Protocol (IP) provides access to the
                subscriber.

            'psdn'
                A Public Switched Data Network (PSDN) provides access to
                the subscriber.

            'ppp'
                The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides access to the
                subscriber.

            'vpdn'
                A Virtual Private Data Network (VPDN) provides access to
                the subscriber.

        The value 'other' cannot be written to an instance of an object.
        However, it serves as a convenient value when an instance of an
        object using this textual convention is not valid."
