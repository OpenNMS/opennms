= Why do I need CORS support?

By default, many browsers implement a _same origin policy_ which prevents making requests to a resource, on an origin that's different from the source origin.

For example, a request originating from a page served from http://www.opennms.org to a resource on http://www.adventuresinoss.com would be considered a cross origin request.

CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) is a standard mechanism used to enable cross origin requests.

* http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/[W3C's CORS Spec]

== How can I enable CORS support?

CORS support for the REST interface (or any other part of the Web UI) can be enabled as follows:

. Open '$OPENNMS_HOME/jetty-webapps/opennms/WEB-INF/web.xml' for editing.

. Apply the CORS filter to the '/rest/' path by removing the comments around the *<filter-mapping>* definition.
The result should look like:
+
[source,xml]
-----------
  <!-- Uncomment this to enable CORS support -->
  <filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>CORS Filter</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/rest/*</url-pattern>
  </filter-mapping>
-----------

. Restart {opennms-product-name}

== How can I configure CORS support?

CORS support is provided by the *org.ebaysf.web.cors.CORSFilter* servlet filter.

Parameters can be configured by modifying the filter definition in the 'web.xml' file referenced above.

By default, the allowed origins parameter is set to '*'.
