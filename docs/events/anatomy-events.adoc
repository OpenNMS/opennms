Events are central to the operation of the _{product-title}_ platform, so it's critical to have a firm grasp of this topic.

IMPORTANT: Whenever something in _{product-title}_ appears to work by magic, it's probably events working behind the curtain.

Events are structured historical records of things that happen in _{product-title}_ and the nodes, interfaces, and services it manages.
Every event has a number of fixed *fields* and zero or more *parameters*.

.Mandatory Fields
UEI (Universal Event Identifier)::
    A string uniquely identifying the event's type.
    UEIs are typically formatted in the style of a URI, but the only requirement is that they start with the string `uei.`.
Event Label::
    A short, static label summarizing the gist of all instances of this event.
Description::
    A long-form description describing all instances of this event.
Log Message::
    A long-form log message describing this event, optionally including expansions of fields and parameters so that the value is tailored to the event at hand.
Severity::
    A severity for this event type.
    Possible values range from `Cleared` to `Critical`.
Event ID::
    A numeric identifier used to look up a specific event in the _{product-title}_ system.

.Notable Optional Fields
Operator Instruction::
    A set of instructions for an operator to respond appropriately to an event of this type.
Alarm Data::
    If this field is provided for an event, _{product-title}_ will create, update, or clear *alarms* for events of that type according to the alarm-data specifics.
    For more about alarms and how they relate to events, see <<alarms-introduction>>.
