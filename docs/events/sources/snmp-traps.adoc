If SNMP-capable devices in the network are configured to send *traps* to _{product-title}_, these traps are transformed into events according to pre-configured rules.
The `Trapd` service daemon, which enables _{product-title}_ to receive SNMP traps, is enabled by default.

IMPORTANT: Disabling the `Trapd` service daemon will render _{product-title}_ *incapable* of receiving SNMP traps.

Event definitions are included with _{product-title}_ for traps from many vendors' equipment.
