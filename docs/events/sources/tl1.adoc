Autonomous messages can be retrieved from certain TL1-enabled equipment and transformed into events.

IMPORTANT: The `Tl1d` service daemon, which enables _{product-title}_ to receive TL1 autonomous messages, must be enabled for this functionality to work.
This service daemon is *disabled* by default.
