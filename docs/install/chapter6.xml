    <title>Common Installation Issues</title>

    <para>The following section contains advice for overcoming common
    installation issues. If your issue is not addressed below, please see the
    section on where to get help.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Dependency Problems</title>

      <para>To assist with code management, the easiest way to install OpenNMS
      is via packages. Every effort has been made to insure that the packages
      OpenNMS depends on are required before the OpenNMS package can be
      installed. You should be able to find those packages on the distribution
      CDs that came with your system. For some of the more obscure packages,
      like <filename>metamail</filename>, you can visit the OpenNMS <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.opennms.org">FTP</ulink> site and check in the
      <filename>/pub/dependencies</filename> directory. In addition, sites
      like <ulink url="http://distro.ibiblio.org/">Ibiblio</ulink> and <ulink
      url="http://www.freshrpms.net">FreshRPMs</ulink> are also good
      sources.</para>

      <title>Error: "Started OpenNMS, but it has not finished starting
      up"</title>

      <para>This can happen for a a number of reasons. You can run
      "<code>opennms -v status</code>" a few times after getting this error to
      see if OpenNMS eventually starts itself completely and if not, to see
      which daemons never start up completely. Hare are some of the likely
      causes of this problem:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>OpenNMS takes a while to startup. This can happen on larger
          installations and when this happens "<code>opennms -v status</code>"
          will eventually show that all services have started up. By default,
          the startup script will try 10 times to see if OpenNMS has started
          and will wait 5 seconds between each try. You can increase the
          number of times by creating
          <filename>$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/opennms.conf</filename> and adding a
          line like "<code>START_TIMEOUT=20</code>" to double the number of
          times it tests. You can set the value to <code>0</code> to have the
          startup script not wait for OpenNMS to start.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Database is not running. If only about half or less of the
          daemons are shown as running. You can check for this condition by
          looking for <code>FATAL</code> errors in the log files. You'll see
          something like "<code>Error accessing database</code>" in the
          logs.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Dhcpd doesn't start. See the item in the next section.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>JNI library problem. OpenNMS uses a few native C libraries
          that are accessed using JNI (Java Native Interface). Normally they
          just work, except users have started seeing problems when running
          Linux in native AMD64 mode where they end up using a 32-bit (x86)
          version of Java and a 64-bit (AMD64) version of the JNI libraries,
          or vice-versa. If you have this problem, you might want to try
          switching your version of Java from 32-bit to 64-bit or in the other
          direction.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Other. If the OpenNMS is installed, and the packages were not
          forced in using options like "<code>--nodeps</code>", the
          application should run just fine. If not, OpenNMS has a robust
          logging facility. Change to the logs directory (usually
          <filename>/var/log/opennms</filename>) and search the logs, using
          <filename>grep</filename> or your tool of choice, for words like
          <code>FATAL</code> and <code>ERROR</code> (the two highest log
          severities). Those events should give you clues as to why OpenNMS is
          not working.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>DHCP Poller Won't Start</title>

      <para>The OpenNMS DHCP poller will fail to start most operating systems
      (Linux, in particular) if you are running a DHCP client on the OpenNMS
      server. You'll see this by running "<code>opennms -v status</code>" and
      seeing everything in the <code>running</code> state, except for
      <code>Dhcpd</code>. The solution is to edit
      <filename>$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/service-configuration.xml</filename> and
      comment-out the "<code>&lt;service&gt;...&lt;/service&gt;</code>" stanza
      for <code>Dhcpd</code>. For example, this is what the section would look
      like after modification to disable <code>Dhcpd</code>:</para>

      <programlisting>        &lt;!-- Commented out since we have a DHCP client on this server
        &lt;service&gt;
                &lt;name&gt;OpenNMS:Name=Dhcpd&lt;/name&gt;
                &lt;class-name&gt;org.opennms.netmgt.dhcpd.jmx.Dhcpd&lt;/class-name&gt;
                &lt;invoke pass="1" method="start"/&gt;
                &lt;invoke at="status" pass="0" method="status"/&gt;
                &lt;invoke at="stop" pass="0" method="stop"/&gt;
        &lt;/service&gt;
        --&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>We discourage the running of OpenNMS on a server that is a DHCP
      client, both because OpenNMS may not be able to monitor DHCP servers on
      the network, and it is important that the monitoring server have a
      static IP address for receiving traps and to be reliant on as few
      network services as possible.</para>

      <title>The OpenNMS Web Application Will Not Start, or You Can't Log
      In</title>

      <para>There are actually two main applications in the OpenNMS product:
      the application itself and the web-based User Interface (webUI). The
      webUI is implemented via Tomcat, and it is possible for Tomcat to be
      running and the OpenNMS application to be stopped and vice versa.</para>

      <para>Before you do anything else, check the platform-specific
      installation notes in this guide. There are a number of common problems
      with Tomcat which are covered there.</para>

      <para>If you can't get to the OpenNMS interface
      (<filename>http://[opennms server]:8080/opennms</filename> or
      <filename>http://[opennms server]:8180/opennms</filename> on Debian -
      where [opennms server] is the name of the OpenNMS machine) make sure
      that Tomcat is running, and if necessary restart it. You should also be
      able to access the main Tomcat page by leaving off the
      "<filename>/opennms</filename>".</para>

      <para>Check to make sure that the OpenNMS web application is installed
      correctly. In Tomcat's <varname>CATALINA_HOME</varname> (usually
      <filename>/var/tomcat4</filename>), you should see a sub-directory
      called <filename>webapps</filename>. Starting in OpenNMS 1.1.4, we no
      longer place the OpenNMS webapp directly into this
      <filename>webapps</filename> directory. Inside of
      <filename>webapps</filename>, you should only see a file (or symbolic
      link) called <filename>opennms.xml</filename>. If you see a directory
      (or symbolic link) called <filename>opennms</filename>, delete it (this
      is not done automatically by the installer when upgrading).</para>

      <para>Also in <varname>CATALINA_HOME</varname> there is a sub-directory
      called conf and in that directory is a file called
      <filename>server.xml</filename>. Before OpenNMS 1.1.4, we needed to add
      a "context" to that file, however this is no longer needed in OpenNMS
      1.1.4. In fact, if you are upgrading from 1.1.3 or earlier, you must
      manually remove this "context" from <filename>server.xml</filename> (it
      is not done automatically when upgrading). Here is what it looks like
      looks like:</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;!-- Example Server Configuration File --&gt;
&lt;Server ...
...
  ...
    &lt;Host ... &gt;
      ....
      &lt;Context path="/opennms" docBase="opennms" debug="0" reloadable="true"&gt;
        &lt;Logger classname="org.opennms.web.log.Log4JLogger" homeDir="/opt/OpenNMS"/&gt;
        &lt;Realm className="org.opennms.web.authenticate.OpenNMSTomcatRealm" homeDir="/opt/OpenNMS"/&gt;
      &lt;/Context &gt;
    &lt;/Host &gt;
  ...
&lt;/Server &gt;</programlisting>

      <para>Tomcat will also need to be aware of various OpenNMS JARs and
      libraries which provide the Java classes which make these directives
      work. To give tomcat access to these resources, links are created in
      <filename>$CATALINA_HOME/server/lib</filename> pointing to the locations
      of the following OpenNMS JARs:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><filename>castor-0.9.3.9.jar -&gt;
          /opt/OpenNMS/lib/castor-0.9.3.9.jar</filename></para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><filename>log4j.jar -&gt;
          /opt/OpenNMS/lib/log4j.jar</filename></para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><filename>opennms_common.jar -&gt;
          /opt/OpenNMS/lib/opennms_common.jar</filename></para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><filename>opennms_core.jar -&gt;
          /opt/OpenNMS/lib/opennms_core.jar</filename></para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><filename><filename>opennms_services.jar -&gt;
          /opt/OpenNMS/lib/opennms_services.jar</filename></filename></para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><filename>opennms_web.jar -&gt;
          /opt/OpenNMS/lib/opennms_web.jar</filename></para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Tomcat has a "working" directory (usually
      <filename>$CATALINA_HOME/work</filename>) where it stores the Java
      source for JSP pages as well as the compiled classes for JSPs. Sometimes
      users see problems with the webapp until the working directory is
      cleared and Tomcat is restarted. We suggest running "<code>rm -rf
      <filename>$CATALINA_HOME/work</filename></code>" if the above items fail
      to get the webapp working.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Error: "runjava: Could not find an appropriate JRE"</title>

      <para>The <code><filename>runjava</filename></code> program is used to
      locate a suitable JRE for OpenNMS at install time that will be used for
      the installer and also for running OpenNMS after installation. See the
      section earlier in this manual on installing Java for OpenNMS. If you
      installed Java in a location that <code>runjava</code> cannot find, you
      can use its "<code>-f</code>" option to specify the JRE you want OpenNMS
      to use.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Error: "The database server's error messages are not in English
      ..."</title>

      <para>You either need to set "<code>lc_messages = 'C'</code>" in your
      postgresql.conf file and restart PostgreSQL or upgrade to PostgreSQL 7.4
      or later.</para>

      <para>The installer does not always verify that an operation will
      succeed before executing the operation (e.g.: dropping database
      functions). In this case, it catches the exceptions returned from the
      database and checks the exception to see if it is an "okay" exception
      that should be ignored (e.g.: if the database function does not exist
      when attempting to drop a function).</para>

      <para>In PostgreSQL 7.4 and later, a new client/server protocol is used
      (version 3, to be specific) that provides specific error codes intended
      for programmatic evaluation and we use these error codes if the server
      provides them. However for PostgreSQL versions before 7.4, we require
      that the database server error language be in English (the
      '<code>C</code>' locale) so that we can parse the text error messages.
      If you are not running PostgreSQL 7.4 or newer, the installer executes a
      bogus query against the database and checks for an expected result in
      English.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Error: "Column X in new table has NOT NULL constraint
      ..."</title>

      <para>This is a warning that the installer might not update tables
      successfully. Make sure that your database is backed up, and run the
      installer again with the "-N" option to ignore this check.</para>

      <para>As an attempt to ensure that the install will complete
      successfully, a check is done to see if there might be any rows with
      NULL columns that might be inserted into a column in an upgrade table
      with a NOT NULL constraint. This usually happens when a previous run of
      the installer failed, or might be due to modifications to the database
      schema or a really old version of the schema.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Error: "One or more backup tables from a previous install still
      exists"</title>

      <para>When the installer runs to upgrade the OpenNMS database from a
      previous install, it often updates table schemas. When it does this, it
      copies the data in a table to a temporary table (e.g.: the contents of
      <filename>node</filename> are copied into
      <filename>node_old_11033991291234</filename>). The original table is
      deleted, the new version of the table is created, the data in the
      temporary table is translated into the new table, and finally the
      temporary table is deleted.</para>

      <para>Unfortunately, the installer cannot check for all problems that
      might break translation, so sometimes the translation step fails. In
      this case, the installer "reverts" the table it was processing by
      dropping the new table and moving the temporary table into its
      place.</para>

      <para>Reverting the table in case of a problem is all good and well, but
      sometimes even it does not work properly, especially with older versions
      of the Java installer. If this happens, the temporary table (the one
      with "_old_" in it) is left with all of the old data. Until OpenNMS
      1.1.5, this problem would not be caught the next time you ran the
      installer. The installer would see that you did not have the
      <filename>node</filename> table, for example, and happily continue to
      create a new one for you. This is bad, especially since you probably
      still have data that you care about that is now in the "old"
      table.</para>

      <para>If you get this error, you will want to get rid of the table(s)
      containing "_old_", however you want to first check if they contain
      data. For example, if you have a single table,
      <filename>node_old_11033991291234</filename>, no other
      <filename>node_old_*</filename> tables, and no <filename>node</filename>
      table, you can simply rename the table:</para>

      <programlisting># <command>psql -h localhost -U opennms opennms</command>
<computeroutput>Welcome to psql 7.4.6, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal.

Type:  \copyright for distribution terms
       \h for help with SQL commands
       \? for help on internal slash commands
       \g or terminate with semicolon to execute query
       \q to quit

opennms=# </computeroutput><command>ALTER TABLE node_old_11033991291234 RENAME TO node;</command></programlisting>

      <para>You can use the "\d" command within <filename>psql</filename> to
      see what other tables exist in your database. You can use
      "<filename>SELECT count(*) from table</filename>;" (fill in the table
      name for "table") to get a count of rows in any table. If you have empty
      tables, you can just drop them. If you have multiple tables with data,
      you will have to decide which table of data you want to keep or merge
      them. This is left as a (not so simple) exercise for the reader.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Error: "Table X contains N rows (out of M) that violate new
      constraint Y"</title>

      <para>Over time OpenNMS extends its database schema to improve
      functionality. This error can happen because of the way certain
      administrative functions in older versions of OpenNMS functioned or if
      the database was modified outside of OpenNMS (the latter is common for
      larger sites). Over time OpenNMS has introduced additional foreign key
      constraints on its database. These are used to ensure internal database
      consistency when data in two tables are tied together by a shared key.
      For example, each event can have a pointer to the node that it is
      related to; there is a foreign key constraint that requires that an
      event <emphasis>must not</emphasis> point at a node that does not
      exist.</para>

      <para>Starting with 1.1.5, when we upgrade the database schema, we first
      check for rows that violate any new foreign key constraints that might
      be added. There are three options to to fix these errors:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Remove the offending rows. This is suggested if the number of
          rows that violate the constraint is small in comparison to the total
          number of rows in the affected table and if you don't need the data.
          Use "<code>$OPENNMS_HOME/bin/install -C &lt;constraint&gt;
          -X</code>" to delete the offending rows.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Mark the key in the offending rows to NULL. This is suggested
          if you need to keep the data around or are not yet sure about what
          to do with it. Use "<code>$OPENNMS_HOME/bin/install -C
          &lt;constraint&gt;</code>" to mark the key column to NULL in the
          offending rows.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Fix the key in the offending rows. This is for advanced users
          and requires a good amount of effort. This is left as an exercise
          for the reader.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <title>Error: "- adding iplike database function... &lt;snip&gt;
	org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: ERROR: could not access file
	'&lt;snip&gt;/lib/iplike.so': Permission denied"</title>

      <para>The PostgreSQL server cannot access the iplike.so file.  This
	could be due to the file itself not having appropriate permissions

	parent directories of the iplike.so not having appropriate
	permissions.</para>

      <para>This error is seen even when running the installer as root
	because it is not OpenNMS nor the installer that cannot access
	the iplike.so file, but the PostgreSQL database.  The installer
	instructs the PostgreSQL database to load the iplike.so and the
	PostgreSQL database server usually runs as a non-root user, so it
	is subject to filesystem access control checks like any other
	normal user.  This is commonly seen when people install OpenNMS

            <para>This is a great list for new users to OpenNMS. The main
            focus is installation issues (cleared up by this great
            documentation, right?) but most "newbie" questions are welcome
            here.</para>

          <glossdef>
            <para>Whether or not to use maps in network management is as
            divisive an issue as abortion or gun control (grin). OpenNMS does
            have a small contributed map system, which still needs a lot of
            work. We can talk about it here.</para>
