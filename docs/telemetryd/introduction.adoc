= Telemetry Daemon

The _Telemetry Daemon_ (_telemetryd_) provides an extensible framework that can be used to handle sensor pushed to _{product-title}_.

_telemetryd_ allows operators to define a series of protocols, each of which has at least one listener, and at least one adapter.
A listener is responsible for receiving sensor data from some external source.
This may include listening for packets from a UDP socket, retrieving messages from an _MQTT_ topic, etc...
An adapters is responsible for processing the byte streams dispatched by the listeners.
For example, this may include decoding a specific _JSON_ format, persisting metrics and/or generating events.

The framework does not make any assumption about the data about being received or processed, leaving this up to the listener and adapter implementations.

Listeners may run on either _{product-title}_ or _Minion_, whereas adapters run exclusively on _{product-title}_.
If a listener is running on _Minion_, the received messages will be automatically dispatched to the associated adapter(s) running in _{product-title}_.

== Supported protocols

We provide built-in support for a number of protocols.
Follow the instructions bellow for enabling these.

=== Junos Telemetry Interface (JTI)

To enable support for Junos Telemetry Interface (JTI), edit `${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/telemetryd-configuration.xml` and change the following line:

```
<protocol name="JTI" description="Junos Telemetry Interface (JTI)" enabled="false">
```

to:

```
<protocol name="JTI" description="Junos Telemetry Interface (JTI)">
```

Apply the changes without restarting by sending a `reloadDaemonConfig` event:

```
${OPENNMS_HOME}bin/send-event.pl -p 'daemonName Telemetryd' uei.opennms.org/internal/reloadDaemonConfig
```

By default, this will open a UDP socket bound to `0.0.0.0:50000` to which JTI messages can be forwarded.

=== Minion

To enable the listener on Minion:

[source]
----
$ ssh -p 8201 admin@localhost
...
admin@minion()> config:edit org.opennms.features.telemetry.listeners-udp-50000
admin@minion()> config:property-set name JTI
admin@minion()> config:property-set class-name org.opennms.netmgt.telemetry.listeners.udp.UdpListener
admin@minion()> config:property-set listener.port 50000
admin@minion()> config:update
----

NOTE: The protocol must also be enabled on _{opennms-product-name}_ for the messages to be processed.
