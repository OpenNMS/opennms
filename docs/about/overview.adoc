= What is {product-title}?

_{product-title}_ is a carrier-grade, highly integrated, open source platform designed for building network monitoring solutions.
There are two distributions of OpenNMS: Meridian and Horizon.
Using Meridian is advisable for enterprises and businesses looking for stability and long term support.
Horizon is the place where innovation happens quickly and is ideal for monitoring new technologies and IT ecosystems.
Both distributions are completely open source.

The software _{product-title}_ addresses the following main functions monitor a huge amount of entities in modern IT networks:

* _Service Assurance_: Detect service outages and measure latency for graphing and thresholding via synthetic polling.
  Out-of-the-box support for many applications with configurable service monitors.
  Remotely monitor applications and services from the user's perspective.
* _Performance Management_: Collect performance metrics from industry standard agents via SNMP, JMX, WMI, NRPE, NSClient++ and XMP simply through configuration.
  Gather performance data from applications via customizable generic collectors with HTTP, JDBC, XML or JSON.
* _Provisioning_: Discover your network and applications through manual, detected, or ReST API driven interfaces via the OpenNMS provisioning system.
  It gives control for device management with the ability to add, change, and remove devices.
* _Integration_: It allows to integrate with ReST API for provisioning or provides monitoring information for external applications.
  Otherwise it can be integrated in workflows as notification and ticketing systems.

== What is a Minion

_Minion_ gives the ability to monitor devices and applications which are in isolated networks and hard to reach from a central _{product-title}_ instance.
Maintaining a large set of _Firewall_ rules to allow a variety of management protocols is sometimes tedious and hard to set up.
Communicating with managed devices over unreliable networks and the use of _UDP_ based management protocols can also be difficult to maintain.
Deploying a _Minion_ can be used to address these issues.

A _Minion_ can be used when a central _{product-title}_ can't reach all devices and _Management Agents_ for monitoring.
Furthermore it simplifies the network communication by using _TCP_-based _ActiveMQ_ and _ReST_ communication.

The network area where access to managed network devices and applications is allowed can be modeled in a _Location_.
Monitored _Nodes_ and _IP Services_ are associated to _Locations_ and are defined during _Provisioning_.
Each _Minion_ is configured with a _Location_ and all _Nodes_ and _IP Services_ in the same _Location_ are monitored through this _Minion_.

NOTE: The _Minion_ is currently not designed to be a replacement for the _Remote Poller_.
      By using the _Remote Poller_ a service can be tested from several remote sites, whereas a _Minion_ extends network reachability for a central _{product-title}_ instance.

The figure <<gi-install-minion-location, _Nodes_ with _Minions_ in _Locations_>> illustrates a _Minion_ deployment in isolated branch offices.

Every _Node_ created in _{product-title}_ is by default created in the _Location_ named _Default_.
All _Nodes_ and _Services_ in the _Default Location_ are handled by the central _{product-title}_ instance itself.
For each branch office in an isolated network, a _Location_ is defined.
The _Minion_ has a configuration property for the _Location_ and will register itself to the {product-title} instance on startup.

The _Provisioning System_ allows to associate _Nodes_ to a _Location_.
_{product-title}_ will delegate monitoring requests for _Nodes_ in the specified _Locations_ to the registered _Minions_ and uses them as a proxy.

Figure <<gi-install-minion-communication, Minion communication>> gives a more detailed overview about the communication between an _{product-title}_ instance and a _Minion_.

[[gi-install-minion-scenario]]
.Minion communication
image::02_minion-communication.png[]

The _Minion_ needs a configuration which requires at minimum the following information:

* An unique identifier (`id`) for this specific _Minion_
* Monitoring _Location_ name (`location`) this _Minion_ is responsible
* The communication endpoints (`broker-url` and `http-url`) for the central _{product-title}_ instance

The configuration resides in a property file in `${MINION_HOME}/etc/org.opennms.minion.controller.cfg`.
When the minimal configuration is set up the _Minion_ can be started and initially connects to the central _{product-title}_ instance and identifies itself with his unique _ID_.

NOTE: The unique _ID_ is generated when the packages get installed `/usr/bin/uuidgen -t` and is used if no _ID_ is set manually.
On upgrade the _ID_ is not updated.


By default the _Minion_ will be automatically provisioned as a _Node_ in the _{product-title}_ instance and get automatically monitored with the _Minion-Heartbeat_ service.
The _Minion_ sends heart beat messages to ensure it is running and functioning properly in this network area.

The specific management protocol messages, e.g. _SNMP_, _ICMP_, are piped through an _ActiveMQ_ messaging communication channel and are executed by a _Minion_.
Responses are forwarded to the central _{product-title}_ instance and are processed accordingly.

_Minions_ can be installed on every system that is able to communicate with these two endpoints:

* The _OpenNMS ReST Interface_, by default _TCP_ port 8980
* The _ActiveMQ_ broker used by _{product-title}_, by default _TCP_ port 61616

The following management protocols are currently supported in a _Minion_ proxy scenario:

* Receive _Syslog_ messages and forward them through _ActiveMQ_ to a central _{product-title}_ instance
* Receive _SNMP Traps_ and forward them through _ActiveMQ_ to a central _{product-title}_ instance
* Act as a proxy for _SNMP_ performance data collections
* Act as a proxy for _Service Monitors_ to test availability and measure response times from applications

IMPORTANT: Packages are only available for _RHEL_-based systems (_RPMS_).

WARNING: To avoid issues, make sure the _Minion_ and the instance of _{product-title}_ have the same version.
