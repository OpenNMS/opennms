= Install jrrd2 Interface

To get access from the _OpenNMS Java Virtual Machine_ you have to install _jrrd2_ as an interface.
You can install it from the _OpenNMS_ package repository with:

.Installation of _jrrd2_ on RHEL/CentOS
[source, shell]
----
yum install jrrd2
----

.Installation of _jrrd2_ on Debian/Ubuntu
[source, shell]
----
apt-get install jrrd2
----

NOTE: It is preferred to use _jrrd2_ instead of _jrrd_.
      The _jrrd2_ module is improved for performance by adding multithreading capabilities.
