The global behavior of _{product-title}_ is configured with Property files.
Configuration can have also effect on the _Java Virtual Machine_ underneath _{product-title}_.
Changes in these property files require a restart of _{product-title}_.
The configuration files can be found in `${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc`.

The priority for _Java system properties_ is as follows:

. Those set via the _Java_ command line i.e. in `opennms.conf` via `ADDITIONAL_MANAGER_OPTIONS`
. `opennms.properties.d/*.properties`
. `opennms.properties`
. `libraries.properties`
. `rrd-configuration.properties`
. `bootstrap.properties`

Property files in `opennms.properties.d/` are sorted alphabetically.

TIP: To avoid conflicts with customized configurations, all custom properties can be added to one or more files in `${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/opennms.properties.d/`.
     It is recommended to avoid modification of OpenNMS properties from the default installation.
     Create dedicated files with your customized properties in `opennms.properties.d/`.
