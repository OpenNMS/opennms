= HTTPS / SSL

This chapter covers the possibilities to configure _{product-title}_ to protect web sessions with HTTPS and also explains how to configure _{product-title}_ to establish secure connections.

NOTE: In order to use HTTPS the Java command line tool `keytool` is used.
      It is automatically shipped with each JRE installation.
      More details about the `keytool` can be found at the link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/windows/keytool.html[official documentation].

[[ga-operation-standalone-https-jetty]]
== Standalone HTTPS with Jetty

To configure _{product-title}_ to protect web sessions with HTTPS please refer to the official _{product-title}_ Wiki article link:http://www.opennms.org/wiki/Standalone_HTTPS_with_Jetty[Standalone HTTPS with Jetty].

[[ga-operation-https-client]]
== {opennms-product-name} as HTTPS client

To establish secure HTTPS connections within Java one has to setup a so called _Java Trust Store_.

The _Java Trust Store_ contains all certificates a Java application should trust when making connections as a client to a server.

[[ga-operation-setup-java-truststore]]
=== Setup _Java Trust Store_

To setup the _Java Trust Store_ the following command can be issued.

NOTE: If you do not have a _Java Trust Store_ setup yet, it is created automatically.

.Import a certificate to the _Java Trust Store_
[source,shell]
----
keytool \
  -import \ <1>
  -v \ <2>
  -trustcacerts \ <3>
  -alias localhost \ <4>
  -file localhost.cert \ <5>
  -keystore /$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/trust-store.jks  <6>
----
<1> Define to import a certificate or a certificate chain
<2> Use verbose output
<3> Define to trust certificates from cacerts
<4> The alias for the certificate to import, e.g. the common name
<5> The certificate to import
<6> The location of the _Java Trust Store_

If you create a new _Java Trust Store_ you are asked for a password to protect the _Java Trust Store_.
If you update an already existing _Java Trust Store_ please enter the password you chose when creating the _Java Trust Store_ initially.

[[ga-operation-download-certificate]]
=== Download existing public certificate

To Download an existing public certificate the following command can be issued.

.Download an existing public certificate
[source,shell]
----
openssl \
  s_client \ <1>
  -showcerts \ <2>
  -connect localhost:443 \ <3>
  -servername localhost \ <4>
  < /dev/null \ <5>
  > localhost.cert <6>
----
<1> Use SSL/TLS client functionality of `openssl`.
<2> Show all certificates in the chain
<3> PORT:HOST to connect to, e.g. localhost:443
<4> This is optional, but if you are serving multiple certificates under one single ip address you may define a server name, otherwise the `ip of localhost`:PORT certificate is returned which may not match the requested server name (`mail.domain.com`, `opennms.domain.com`, `dns.domain.com`)
<5> No input
<6> Where to store the certificate.

[[ga-operation-ssl-opennms-trust-store]]
=== Configure {opennms-product-name} to use the defined _Java Trust Store_

To setup _{product-title}_ to use the defined _Java Trust Store_ the according `javax.net.ssl.trustStore*` properties have to be set.
Open `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/opennms.properties` and add the properties `javax.net.ssl.trustStore` and `javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword` as shown below.

.$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/opennms.properties snippet to define a _Java Trust Store_
[source]
----
javax.net.ssl.trustStore=/$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/trust-store.jks <1>
javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=change-me <2>
----
<1> The location of the _Java Trust Store_
<2> The password of the _Java Trust Store_

For more details on the Java build-in SSL System properties have a look at chapter <<ga-operation-ssl-properties,Debugging / Properties>>.

NOTE: Each time you modify the _Java Trust Store_ you have to restart _{product-title}_ to have the changes take effect.

[[ga-operation-trust-store-key-store]]
== Differences between _Java Trust Store_ and _Java Key Store_

The _Java Trust Store_ is used to determine whether a remote connection should be trusted or not, e.g. whether a remote party is who it claims to be (client use case).

The _Java Key Store_ is used to decide which authentication credentials should be sent to the remote host for authentication during SSL handshake (server use case).

For more details, please check the link:http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#Stores[JSSE Reference Guide].

[[ga-operation-ssl-properties]]
== Debugging / Properties

If you encounter issues while using HTTPS it might be useful to enable debugging or use one of the build-in Java System Properties to configure the proper use of SSL.

|System Property Name                |Description
| `javax.net.ssl.keyStore`           | Location of the Java keystore file containing an application process's own certificate and private key.
                                       On Windows, the specified pathname must use forward slashes, `/`, in place of backslashes, `\`.
| `javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword`   | Password to access the private key from the keystore file specified by `javax.net.ssl.keyStore`.
                                       This password is used twice: to unlock the keystore file (store password) and to decrypt the private key stored in the keystore (key password).
                                       In other words, the JSSE framework requires these passwords to be identical.
| `javax.net.ssl.keyStoreType`       | (Optional) For Java keystore file format, this property has the value `jks` (or `JKS`). You do not normally specify this property, because its default value is already `jks`.
| `javax.net.ssl.trustStore`         | Location of the Java keystore file containing the collection of CA certificates trusted by this application process (trust store). On Windows, the specified pathname must use forward slashes, `/`, in place of backslashes, `\`.
                                       If a trust store location is not specified using this property, the Sun JSSE implementation searches for and uses a keystore file in the following locations (in order):
                                       `$JAVA_HOME/lib/security/jssecacerts` and `$JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts`
| `javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword` | Password to unlock the keystore file (store password) specified by `javax.net.ssl.trustStore`.
| `javax.net.ssl.trustStoreType`     | (Optional) For Java keystore file format, this property has the value `jks` (or `JKS`). You do not normally specify this property, because its default value is already `jks`.
| `javax.net.debug`                  | To switch on logging for the SSL/TLS layer, set this property to ssl. More details about possible values can be found link:http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#Debug[here].
