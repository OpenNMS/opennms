= Cassandra Monitoring

This section describes some of the metrics _{product-title}_ collects from a _Cassandra_ cluster.

TIP: JMX must be enabled on the _Cassandra_ nodes and made accessible from __{product-title}_ in order to collect these metrics.
     See link:https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/3.0/cassandra/configuration/secureJmxAuthentication.html[Enabling JMX authentication] for details.

TIP: The data collection is bound to the agent IP interface with the service name _JMX-Cassandra_.
     The _JMXCollector_ is used to retrieve the _MBean_ entities from the _Cassandra_ node.

== Client Connections

The number of active client connections from `org.apache.cassandra.metrics.Client` are collected:

[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Name                     | Description
| `connectedNativeClients` | Metrics for connected native clients
| `connectedThriftClients` | Metrics for connected thrift clients
|===

== Compaction Bytes

The following compaction manager metrics from `org.apache.cassandra.metrics.Compaction` are collected:

[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Name             | Description
| `BytesCompacted` | Number of bytes compacted since node started
|===

== Compaction Tasks

The following compaction manager metrics from `org.apache.cassandra.metrics.Compaction` are collected:

[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Name             | Description
| `CompletedTasks` | Estimated number of completed compaction tasks
| `PendingTasks`   | Estimated number of pending compaction tasks
|===

== Storage Load

The following storage load metrics from `org.apache.cassandra.metrics.Storage` are collected:

[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Name   | Description
| `Load` | Total disk space (in bytes) used by this node
|===

== Storage Exceptions

The following storage exception metrics from `org.apache.cassandra.metrics.Storage` are collected:

[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Name         | Description
| `Exceptions` | Number of unhandled exceptions since start of this _Cassandra_ instance
|===

== Dropped Messages

Measurement of messages that were _DROPPABLE_.
These ran after a given timeout set per message type so was thrown away.
In _JMX_ these are accessible via `org.apache.cassandra.metrics.DroppedMessage`.
The number of dropped messages in the different message queues are good indicators whether a cluster can handle its load.

[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Name               | Stage                  | Description
| `Mutation`         | _MutationStage_        | If a write message is processed after its timeout (write_request_timeout_in_ms) it either sent a failure to the client or it met its requested consistency level and will relay on hinted handoff and read repairs to do the mutation if it succeeded.
| `Counter_Mutation` | _MutationStage_        | If a write message is processed after its timeout (write_request_timeout_in_ms) it either sent a failure to the client or it met its requested consistency level and will relay on hinted handoff and read repairs to do the mutation if it succeeded.
| `Read_Repair`      | _MutationStage_        | Times out after write_request_timeout_in_ms.
| `Read`             | _ReadStage_            | Times out after read_request_timeout_in_ms.
                                                No point in servicing reads after that point since it would of returned error to client.
| `Range_Slice`      | _ReadStage_            | Times out after range_request_timeout_in_ms.
| `Request_Response` | _RequestResponseStage_ | Times out after request_timeout_in_ms.
                                                Response was completed and sent back but not before the timeout
|===

== Thread pools

_Apache Cassandra_ is based on a so called _Staged Event Driven Architecture_ (SEDA).
This seperates different operations in stages and these stages are loosely coupled using a messaging service.
Each of these components use queues and thread pools to group and execute their tasks.
The documentation for _Cassandra_ Thread pool monitoring is originated from link:http://www.pythian.com/blog/guide-to-cassandra-thread-pools[Pythian Guide to Cassandra Thread Pools].

.Collected metrics for Thread Pools
[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Name                    | Description
| `ActiveTasks`           | Tasks that are currently running
| `CompletedTasks`        | Tasks that have been completed
| `CurrentlyBlockedTasks` | Tasks that have been blocked due to a full queue
| `PendingTasks`          | Tasks queued for execution
|===

=== Memtable FlushWriter

Sort and write _memtables_ to disk from `org.apache.cassandra.metrics.ThreadPools`.
A vast majority of time this backing up is from over running disk capability.
The sorting can cause issues as well however.
In the case of sorting being a problem, it is usually accompanied with high load but a small amount of actual flushes (seen in cfstats).
Can be from huge rows with large column names, i.e. something inserting many large values into a _CQL_ collection.
If overrunning disk capabilities, it is recommended to add nodes or tune the configuration.

TIP: Alerts: pending > 15 || blocked > 0

=== Memtable Post Flusher

Operations after flushing the _memtable_.
Discard commit log files that have had all data in them in _sstables_.
Flushing non-cf backed secondary indexes.

TIP: Alerts: pending > 15 || blocked > 0

=== Anti Entropy Stage

Repairing consistency.
Handle repair messages like merkle tree transfer (from Validation compaction) and streaming.

TIP: Alerts: pending > 15 || blocked > 0

=== Gossip Stage

Post 2.0.3 there should no longer be issue with pending tasks.
Instead monitor logs for a message:

[source]
----
Gossip stage has {} pending tasks; skipping status check ...
----

Before that change, in particular older versions of 1.2, with a lot of nodes (100+) while using vnodes can cause a lot of CPU intensive work that caused the stage to get behind.
Been known to of been caused with out of sync schemas.
Check _NTP_ working correctly and attempt `nodetool resetlocalschema` or the more drastic deleting of system column family folder.

TIP: Alerts: pending > 15 || blocked > 0

=== Migration Stage

Making schema changes

TIP: Alerts: pending > 15 || blocked > 0

=== MiscStage

Snapshotting, replicating data after node remove completed.

TIP: Alerts: pending > 15 || blocked > 0

=== Mutation Stage

Performing a local including:

* insert/updates
* Schema merges
* commit log replays
* hints in progress

Similar to ReadStage, an increase in pending tasks here can be caused by disk issues, over loading a system, or poor tuning. If messages are backed up in this stage, you can add nodes, tune hardware and configuration, or update the data model and use case.

TIP: Alerts: pending > 15 || blocked > 0

=== Read Stage

Performing a local read.
Also includes deserializing data from row cache.
If there are pending values this can cause increased read latency.
This can spike due to disk problems, poor tuning, or over loading your cluster.
In many cases (not disk failure) this is resolved by adding nodes or tuning the system.

TIP: Alerts: pending > 15 || blocked > 0

=== Request Response Stage

When a response to a request is received this is the stage used to execute any callbacks that were created with the original request.

TIP: Alerts: pending > 15 || blocked > 0

=== Read Repair Stage

Performing read repairs.
Chance of them occurring is configurable per column family with `read_repair_chance`.
More likely to back up if using `CL.ONE` (and to lesser possibly other `non-CL.ALL` queries) for reads and using multiple data centers.
It will then be kicked off asynchronously outside of the queries feedback loop.
Note that this is not very likely to be a problem since does not happen on all queries and is fast providing good connectivity between replicas.
The repair being droppable also means that after `write_request_timeout_in_ms` it will be thrown away which further mitigates this.
If pending grows attempt to lower the rate for high read `CFs`.

TIP: Alerts: pending > 15 || blocked > 0

== JVM Metrics

Some key metrics from the running Java virtual machine are also collected:

java.lang:type=Memory::
  The memory system of the Java virtual machine. This includes heap and non-heap memory
java.lang:type=GarbageCollector,name=ConcurrentMarkSweep::
  Metrics for the garbage collection process of the Java virtual machine

TIP: If you use _Apache Cassandra_ for running _Newts_ you can also enable additional metrics for the _Newts_ keyspace.
