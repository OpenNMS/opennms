= Newts Monitoring

This section describes the metrics _{product-title}_ collects for monitoring the _Newts_ keyspace from `org.apache.cassandra.metrics.Keyspace` on an _Cassandra_ node.

TIP: JMX must be enabled on the _Cassandra_ nodes and made accessible from __{product-title}_ in order to collect these metrics.
     See link:https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/3.0/cassandra/configuration/secureJmxAuthentication.html[Enabling JMX authentication] for details.

The data collection is bound to the agent IP interface with the service name _JMX-Cassandra-Newts_.
The _JMXCollector_ is used to retrieve the _MBean_ entities from the _Cassandra_ node.
