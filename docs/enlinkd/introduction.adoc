= Introduction

_Enhanced Linkd (Enlinkd)_ has been designed to discover connections between nodes using data generated by various link discovery protocols and accessible via SNMP.
_Enlinkd_ gathers this data on a regular interval and creates a snapshot of a device's neighbors from its perspective.
The connections discovered by _Enlinkd_ are called _Links_.
The term _Link_, within the context of _Enlinkd_, is not synonymous with the term "link" when used with respect to the network OSI _Layer 2_ domain, whereby a link only indicates a _Layer 2_ connection.
A _Link_ in context of _Enlinkd_ is a more abstract concept and is used to describe any connection between two _{product-title} Nodes_.
These _Links_ are discovered based on information provided by an agent's understanding of connections at the OSI _Layer 2_, _Layer 3_, or other OSI layers.

The following sections describe the _Enlinkd_ daemon and its configuration.
Additionally, the supported _Link discovery_ implementations will be described as well as a list of the SNMP MIBs that the SNMP agents must expose in order for _EnLinkd_ to gather _Links_ between _Nodes_.
FYI: Detailed information about a node's connections (discovered _Links_) and supporting link data can be seen on the _Node detail page_ within the _{product-title}_ Web-UI.

== Enlinkd Daemon

Essentially _Enlinkd_ asks each device the following question: "What is the network topology from your point of view".
From this point of view this will only provide local topology discovery features.
It does not attempt to discover global topology or to do any correlation with the data coming from other nodes.

For large environments the behavior of _Enlinkd_ can be configured.
During the _Link_ discovery process informational and error output is logged to a global log file.

| Attribute              | Type      | Default    | Description
| `threads`              | _Integer_ | `5`        | Number of parallel threads used to discover the topology.
| `initial_sleep_time`   | _Integer_ | `60000`    | Time in milliseconds to wait for discovering the topology after {product-title} is started.
| `rescan_interval`      | _Integer_ | `86400000` | Interval to rediscover and update the topology in milliseconds.
| `use-cdp-discovery`    | _Boolean_ | `true`     | Enable or disable topology discovery based on _CDP_ information.
| `use-bridge-discovery` | _Boolean_ | `true`     | Enable or disable algorithm to discover the topology based on the _Bridge MIB_ information.
| `use-lldp-discovery`   | _Boolean_ | `true`     | Enable or disable topology discovery based on _LLDP_ information.
| `use-ospf-discovery`   | _Boolean_ | `true`     | Enable or disable topology discovery based on _OSPF_ information.
| `use-isis-discovery`   | _Boolean_ | `true`     | Enable or disable topology discovery based on _IS-IS_ information.
|===

NOTE: If multiple protocols are enabled, the links will be discovered for each enabled discovery protocol.
      The topology WebUI will visualize _Links_ for each discovery protocol.
      For example if you start _CDP_ and _LLDP_ discovery, the WebUI will visualize a _CDP Link_ and an _LLDP Link_.
