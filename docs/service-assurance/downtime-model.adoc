= Downtime Model

By default the monitoring interval for a service is 5 minutes.
To detect also short services outages, caused for example by automatic network rerouting, the downtime model can be used.
On a detected service outage, the interval is reduced to 30 seconds for 5 minutes.
If the service comes back within 5 minutes, a shorter outage is documented and the impact on service availability can be less than 5 minutes.
This behavior is called _Downtime Model_ and is configurable.

In figure <<ga-service-assurance-downtime-model, Outages and Downtime Model>> there are two outages.
The first outage shows a short outage which was detected as _up_ after 90 seconds.
The second outage is not resolved now and the monitor has not detected an available service and was not available in the first 5 minutes (10 times 30 second polling).
The scheduler changed the polling interval back to 5 minutes.

<1> from 0 seconds after an outage is detected until 5 minutes the polling interval will be set to 30 seconds
<2> after 5 minutes of an ongoing outage until 12 hours the polling interval will be set to 5 minutes
<3> after 12 hours of an ongoing outage until 5 days the polling interval will be set to 10 minutes
<4> after 5 days of an ongoing outage the service will be deleted from the monitoring system
