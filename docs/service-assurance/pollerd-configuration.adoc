= Pollerd

In _{product-title}_ the daemon to measures service availability and latency is done by _Pollerd_.
To run these tests _Service Monitors_ are scheduled and run in parallel in a _Thread Pool_.
The behavior of _Pollerd_ uses the following files for configuration and logging.
Functionalities and general concepts are described in the _User Documentation_ of _{product-title}_.
This section describes how to configure _Pollerd_ for service assurance with all available _Service Monitors_ coming with _{product-title}_.

| File                                          | Description
| `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/poller-configuration.xml`  | Configuration file for monitors and global daemon configuration
| `$OPENNMS_HOME/logs/poller.log`               | Log file for all monitors and the global _Pollerd_
| `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/response-graph.properties` | RRD graph definitions for service response time measurements
| `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/events/opennms.events.xml` | Event definitions for _Pollerd_, i.e. _nodeLostService_, _interfaceDown_ or _nodeDown_
|===

To change the behavior for service monitoring, the `poller-configuration.xml` can be modified.
The configuration file is structured in the following parts:

* _Global daemon config_: Define the size of the used _Thread Pool_ to run _Service Monitors_ in parallel.
  Define and configure the _Critical Service_ for _Node Event Correlation_.
* _Polling packages_: Package to allow grouping of configuration parameters for _Service Monitors_.
* _Downtime Model_: Configure the behavior of _Pollerd_ to run tests in case of an _Outage_ is detected.
* _Monitor service association_: Based on the name of the service, the implementation for application or network management protocols are assigned.

.Global configuration parameters for Pollerd
[source, xml]
----
<poller-configuration threads="30" <1>
                      pathOutageEnabled="false" <2>
                      serviceUnresponsiveEnabled="false"> <3>
----

<1> Size of the _Thread Pool_ to run _Service Monitors_ in parallel
<2> Enable or Disable _Path Outage_ functionality based on a _Critical Node_ in a network path
<3> In case of unresponsive service services a _serviceUnresponsive_ event is generated and not an outage.
    It prevents to apply the _Downtime Model_ to retest the service after 30 seconds and prevents false alarms.

Configuration changes are applied by restarting _{product-title}_ and _Pollerd_.
It is also possible to send an _Event_ to _Pollerd_ reloading the configuration.
An _Event_ can be sent on the _CLI_ or the _Web User Interface_.

.Send configuration reload event on CLI
[source, shell]
----
cd $OPENNMS_HOME/bin
./send-event.pl uei.opennms.org/internal/reloadDaemonConfig --parm 'daemonName Pollerd'
----

IMPORTANT: If you define *new* services in `poller-configuration.xml` a service restart of _{product-title}_ is necessary.
