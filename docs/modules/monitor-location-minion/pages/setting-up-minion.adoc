= Installing and Configuring a Minion

A Minion is an instance of the Karaf OSGi service that enables OpenNMS to monitor devices and services in locations that an OpenNMS instance cannot reach. Minions communicate with these remote devices while OpenNMS performs coordination and task delegation.

Minions can operate behind a firewall and/or network address translation (NAT) as long as they can communicate with OpenNMS via ActiveMQ, Apache Kafka, or gRPC. 

This chapter describes how to install a Minion and configure an authenticated unencrypted communication between Minion and {opennms-product-name} using ActiveMQ and REST.

== Requirements

* Identical version numbers for {opennms-product-name} instance and Minion package
* {opennms-product-name} installed and communication to the REST (8980/tcp) and ActiveMQ (616161/tcp) endpoints is possible 

NOTE: For communication between {opennms-product-name} and Kafka, see <<kafka-setup, Setup using Apache Kafka>>. For gRPC, see <<minion-grpc, Minion with gRPC strategy>>.

If the instruction refers to `${MINION_HOME}`, the path for Minion resolves to the following directory, depending on the operating system:
