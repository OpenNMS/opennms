= Remedy Ticketing Plugin

The Remedy ticketing plugin creates requests in the BMC Remedy ARS Help Desk Module in response to {page-component-title} alarms.

== Remedy product overview
It's important to be specific when discussing Remedy, because BMC Remedy is a suite of products.
The {page-component-title} Remedy ticketing plugin requires the core Remedy ARS and the Help Desk Module.
The Help Desk Module contains a Help Desk Interface Web Service, which serves as the endpoint for creating, updating, and fetching tickets.

The Help Desk Interface (HDI) Web Service requires extensive configuration for its basic operation, and may need additional customization to interoperate with the {page-component-title} Remedy ticketing plugin.
Contact your Remedy administrator for help with required configuration tasks.

In the same file, set the property `opennms.alarmTroubleTicketLinkTemplate` to a value appropriate for constructing a link to tickets in the Remedy web interface.
You must customize the sample value for your site.
The token `$\{id}` will be replaced with the Remedy ticket ID when the link is rendered.
