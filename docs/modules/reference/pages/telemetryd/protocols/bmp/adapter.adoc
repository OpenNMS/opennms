= BMP Telemetry Adapter
:description: Learn about the BMP telemetry adapter in OpenNMS {page-component-title} that handles BMP statistics that the BMP parser receives and parses.

The BMP telemetry adapter handles BMP statistics that the xref:telemetryd/protocols/bmp/parser.adoc[BMP parser] receives and parses.
Statistics received from the router are associated as performance data with that router.
The router must exist as a regular node in {page-component-title}.

{page-component-title} uses the IP address exported in BMP messages to associate a router with the appropriate {page-component-title} node.
In addition, you can use the node's metadata to specify a BGP ID to associate routers.
If the parameter `metaDataNodeLookup` is not empty, it will be interpreted as a `context:key` metadata name, used to look up a node that has stored the queried BGP ID as a value in the specified key.
It is also possible to specify more than one associations by providing a comma-separated list of BGP IDs.
