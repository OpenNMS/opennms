= BGP Monitoring Protocol

The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) provides a convenient interface for obtaining route views.
The integration in {page-component-title} lets you use these route views, status updates, and statistics for monitoring and management.

The following sections provide details about associated parsers, adapters, and listeners.

== Distributed BMP processing with Sentinel

You can use Sentinel to process BMP statistics ingested by one or more Minions in order to alleviate load on the core.
All of the BMP-related adapters can run on Sentinel, allowing you to generate events and metrics, and ingest route changes.
In this mode, events are sent back to the message broker for the core to process and metrics are persisted directly to the time series database.

TIP: The https://github.com/OpenNMS-forge/bmp-playground[BMP Playground] provides a virtual lab that you can use to simulate BGP, BMP, and to see how the {page-component-title} components can be configured at runtime.
