= BGP Monitoring Protocol

The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) provides a convenient interface for obtaining route views.
The integration in {page-component-title} lets you use these route views, status updates, and statistics for monitoring and management.

The following sections provide details about associated parsers, adapters, and listeners.

== Distributed BMP processing with Sentinel

Sentinel can be used to process BMP statistics ingested by one or more Minions in order to alleviate load on the core.
All of the BMP related adapters can be ran on Sentinel, allowing you to generate events, metrics and ingest route changes.
In this mode, events are sent back to the message broker to be processed by the core and metrics are persisted directly to the time-series database.

TIP: The https://github.com/OpenNMS-forge/bmp-playground[BMP Playground] provides a virtual lab that can be used to simulate BGP, BMP, and see how the OpenNMS components can be configured at runtime.
