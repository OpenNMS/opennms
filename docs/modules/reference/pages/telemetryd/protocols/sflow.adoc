= sFlow

sFlow is capable of transporting both telemetry data and flow information.
{page-component-title} can use both data types and extract and persist accordingly.

See <<operation:deep-dive/flows/introduction.adoc#ga-flow-support-introduction, Flow Support>> for details on flow support in {page-component-title}.


[[telemetryd-sflow-parser-udp]]
== sFlow UDP Parser

The sFlow UDP parser accepts packets received by a <deep-dive/<telemetryd/listeners/udp.adoc#telemetryd-listener-udp, UDP listener>> and must forward them to a <<deep-dive/telemetryd-sflow-adapter, sFlow adapter>>.

The sFlow UDP parser supports protocol detection.

[[telemetryd-sflow-adapter-flow]]
== sFlow adapter

The sFlow adapter handles sFlow data received and parsed by the <<deep-dive/telemetryd-sflow-parser, sFlow parser>>.
Flows are decoded from the messages into the canonical flow format and published to the flow repository.

[[telemetryd-sflow-adapter-telemetry]]
== sFlow telemetry adapter

The sFlow telemetry adapter handles sFlow telemetry data received and parsed by the <<deep-dive/telemetryd-sflow-parser-udp, sFlow UDP parser>>.
The telemetry data is forwarded to a JSR-223-compatible script (for example, Beanshell or Groovy) for further processing.
Using the script extension, you can extract the desired metrics from the sFlow messages and persist the results as time series data.

=== Configuration and use

.Required adapter-specific parameters
[options="header", cols="1,3,1"]
|===
| Parameter
| Description
| Default

| script
| Full path to the script used to handle the sFlow messages.
| none

| applicationDataCollection
| Enables data collection of bytesIn/bytesOut based on flow applications.
| false

| applicationThresholding
| Enables thresholding based on flow applications.
| false
|===
NOTE: For data collection to work properly you must also define a valid package definition inside your adapter configuration.

=== Scripting

The script will be invoked for every sFlow (extended) counter sample that is received.

The following globals will be passed to the script:
