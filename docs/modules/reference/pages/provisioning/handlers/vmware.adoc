[[vmware-handler]]
= VMWare Handler

The VMware adapter pulls hosts and/or virtual machines from a vCenter server into {page-component-title}.
With this adapter, you can automatically add, update, or remove nodes from your {page-component-title} based on the status of the VMware entity.
The adapter also lets {page-component-title} collect additional performance metrics directly from the VMware server based on stats stored by the hypervisor.

== Prepare VMware credentials

To allow communication between OpenNMS and VMware, you must create a user and a role for authentication and permissions.
You can either create a new local user within your vCenter server or use an account that has been defined in an external authentication system that is set up to access your vCenter instance.

=== Create a new vCenter role:
. Log into vCenter Server.
. Go to menu:Home[Administration > Roles].
. Select the built-in "Read Only" role.
. Select the option to clone the role and name the new role "OpenNMS-Access" (or another name to your preference).
. Edit the new role to add the menu:Host[CIM > CIM Interaction] permission.
. Click *OK* to save the role.

Once the role is set up, you will need to assign it to the user account.
You can either create a new user for the role or assign the role to a user from an external authentication directory on your vCenter.

=== Assign user permissions to access vCenter objects

. In your vCenter, navigate to menu:Home[Inventory > Hosts and Clusters].
. Right-click on the container to apply the permission.
** If you want {page-component-title} to import all entities, this would be the root vCenter level.
** To import only a subset of nodes, select a specific data center, cluster, or host.
. Select *Add Permission* from the right-click menu.
. Enter the name of the user account to use to connect to vCenter during the import process.
. Select the "OpenNMS-Access" role (or whatever you called it in the previous step).
. Save the role assignment and make sure to propagate to child objects, if prompted.

== Provide credentials to {page-component-title}

Now that you have configured vCenter to allow access to read objects, you must set up {page-component-title} to be able to connect to vCenter.
In the `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/vmware-config.xml` file, add a line with the hostname, user, and password to connect to your vCenter server.
If you have multiple vCenter servers, you can specify multiple `<vmware-server />` objects in this file.

[source, xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<vmware-config>
    <vmware-server hostname="vcenter.mydomain.org" username="domain\username" password="secret"/>
</vmware-config>
----

NOTE: When specifying the username, make sure to fully qualify it with the appropriate domain name for your directory.

== Configure VMware requisition

ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Horizon"]
Prior to {page-component-title} 30, you set external requisitions in the `provisiond-configuration.xml` file.
This file is no longer available.
You must use the UI or the xref:development:rest/config_management.adoc#config-rest-api[config management REST API] to configure an external requisition.
endif::[]

To configure a VMware requisition, follow the steps in xref:reference:provisioning/handlers/introduction.adoc#create-req-def[Create an external requisition], but specify VMWare as the type, the host (name must match the case of the hostname entered in the `vmware-config.xml` file), username, password, schedule, and rescan behavior.

By default, the handler detects and adds all running hosts and virtual machines to the requisition.

Add additional parameters as key/value pairs in the *Advanced Options* area.

NOTE: If you do not import powered-off or standby entities, they will be removed and re-added to {page-component-title} based on their power state.
This can cause their database ID to change over time.
Enabling the https://opennms.discourse.group/t/storing-data-with-foreign-sources/2057[storeByForeignSource] setting can help make sure collected metrics are kept properly.

== Provision a subset of VMware entities

To provision an arbitrary selection of VMware entities, you can specify a key-value pair to match objects that have a specific attribute in vCenter.
The key to look up is a user-defined attribute for entities being imported.
If the value provided starts with a `~`, the value will be treated as a regular expression.
Only one key-value pair can be specified per requisition.

[source, xml]
----
<requisition-def import-name="vmware-requisition"
    import-url-resource="vmware://<vcenter-host>/VCenterImport?key=OpenNMS-Import;value=yes">
----

If you need to specify several attributes, use the `_[customAttributeName]` parameter

[source, xml]
----
<requisition-def import-name="vmware-requisition"
    import-url-resource="vmware://<vcenter-host>/VCenterImport?_OpenNMS-Import=yes">
