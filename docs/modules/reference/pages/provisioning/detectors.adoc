= Detectors

This section describes all available built-in xref:operation:deep-dive/provisioning/introduction.adoc[provisioning] detectors.
You can configure them to allow complex detection to meet the needs of your environment.
For information on how to extend the functionality of these detectors, see the xref:development:development.adoc#development[Development section] to contribute to the project.

== Common configuration parameters

Application- or device-specific detectors are based on a generic API that provides common configuration parameters.
These minimum configuration parameters are available in all detectors and describe the behavior for timeouts, retries, and so on.

.Optional common configuration parameters
[options="header"]
[cols="1,3,2"]
|===
| Parameter
| Description
| Default value

| ipMatch
| IP address to match.
Use filters to match single addresses or address ranges.
Substrings are matched by default (see note below this table for information on regular expression matching).
|

| retries
| Number of times detector should try to connect to database.
|

| serviceName
| A custom service name to identify the service.
|

| timeout
| Response time limit (in milliseconds).
| 2000
|===

NOTE: If there is a `~` at the beginning of a parameter's value, the rest of the string will be handled as a regular expression pattern match.
Otherwise, it will be processed as a substring match.
The regular expression match is anchored at the beginning and end of the line, so you will likely need to put a `.*` on both sides of your pattern unless you are going to match on the entire line.

[[ref-detector-provisioning-meta-data]]
== Metadata DSL
Service detectors can use <<operation:deep-dive/meta-data.adoc#ga-meta-data-dsl, MetaData DSL>> (domain specific language) to leverage dynamic configuration in parameter values to interpolate metadata into the parameter.

The syntax lets you use patterns in an expression, whereby the metadata is replaced with a corresponding value during the collection process.

During evaluation of an expression, the following scopes are available:

* Node metadata
* Interface metadata
