= Detectors

This section describes all available built-in xref:operation:provisioning/introduction.adoc[provisioning] detectors.
You can configure them to allow complex detection to meet the needs of your environment.
For information on how to extend the functionality of these detectors, see the xref:development:development.adoc#development[Development section] to contribute to the project.

== Metadata DSL
Service detectors can use <<operation:meta-data.adoc#ga-meta-data-dsl, MetaData DSL>> (domain specific language) to leverage dynamic configuration in parameter values to interpolate metadata into the parameter.

The syntax lets you use patterns in an expression, whereby the metadata is replaced with a corresponding value during the collection process.

During evaluation of an expression, the following scopes are available:

* Node metadata
* Interface metadata
