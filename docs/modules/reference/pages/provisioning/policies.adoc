= Policies

This section describes all available built-in xref:operation:provisioning/introduction.adoc[provisioning] policies.
You can configure them to allow node modifications or change provisioning behavior to meet the needs of your environment.

For information on how to extend the functionality of these policies, see the xref:development:development.adoc#development[Development section] to contribute to the project.

== Common policy parameters

The matchBehavior action is a boolean control that determines how the optional parameters will be evaluated.
Setting this parameterâ€™s value to `ALL_PARAMETERS` causes Provisiond to evaluate each optional parameter with boolean AND logic and the value `ANY_PARAMETERS` causes OR logic to be applied.

String values are assumed to be a substring match, unless the parameter is prefixed with `~` to indicate the policy should evaluate as a regular expression.
