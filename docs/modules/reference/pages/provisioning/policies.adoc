= Policies

This section describes all available built-in xref:operation:provisioning/introduction.adoc[provisioning] policies.
You can configure them to allow node modifications or change provisioning behavior to meet the needs of your environment.

For information on how to extend the functionality of these policies, see the xref:development:development.adoc#development[Development section] to contribute to the project.

== Common policy parameters

The matchBehavior action is a boolean control that determines how the optional parameters will be evaluated.

ALL_PARAMETERS::
    All defined parameters must match (AND Boolean logic) for the policy to apply.
ANY_PARAMETERS::
    Any defined parameters can match (OR Boolean logic) for the policy to apply.
NO_PARAMETERS::
    No defined parameters can match (opposite of ANY_PARAMETERS) for the policy to apply.

String values are assumed to be a substring match, unless the parameter is prefixed with `~` to indicate the policy should evaluate as a regular expression.
