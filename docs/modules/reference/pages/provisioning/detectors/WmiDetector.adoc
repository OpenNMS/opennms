= WMI Service Detector

The WMIDetector detects the availability of WMIConfiguration on a device when scanning it using Provisiond.
By default, it expects to make a WMI query to the `Win32_ComputerSystem` class, checking for `OK` from the Status object.

| Parameter
| Description
| Default value

| username
| The username to use when authenticating against the WMI host.
| Administrator

| password
| The password to use when authenticating against the WMI host.
| none

| domain
| The Windows domain to use when authenticating against the WMI host.
| WORKGROUP

| wmiClass
| The class of instances within WMI.
An example would be the `Win32_ComputerSystem` class.
This class contains objects representing properties and methods available.
| Win32_ComputerSystem

| wmiObject
| A WMI object is technically a member of a WMI property set.
Using the previous example of `Win32_ComputerSystem`, this class contains a variety of properties that we can look at and poll.
The default WMI service uses the `Status` property to determine if the system is running and if WMI is available.
| Status

| wmiWqlStr
| Microsoft WMI also implements an `ExecQuery` method that is more common in Windows scripting but less common in OpenNMS polling and monitoring.
WQL is a simple, SQL-like syntax used to query WMI classes, properties, and instances.
Here's an example of a WQL query that you could use to discover whether a Windows service is running:
`Select State From Win32_Service Where Name='Server'`
| NOTSET

| compVal
| The value to use when performing a comparison against the WMIObject.
| OK

| compOp
| The compare operation is how you tell the OpenNMS WMI poller plugins how to verify the nature (up, critical) of a specific property within WMI.
In the event of unequal comparisons, the system will always have the WMI value (as retrieved from the target) on the left.
Available compare operations are:

* *EQ*: equals
* *NEQ*: not equals
* *GT*: greater than
* *LT*: less than
* *NOOP*: no operation

The `NOOP` operation is a special case in which the Manager will always return a result code of `OK`.
This is typically used in scenarios where the existence of a class or property is more interesting than the contents of the property.
This can be used to ensure that WMI data is available before adding a collectd service based on the `WmiCollector` class.
| EQ

| matchType
| The match type configuration tells the system how to handle multiple instance results.
Available match types are:

* *all*: all instances must comply to the compare operation.
* *none*: no instances should comply with the compare operation.
* *some*: one or more must comply with the compare operation.
* *one*: only one instance can comply with the compare operation.
| all

| namespace
| Every WMI class exists in a namespace.
The default namespace for most common classes is `root/cimv2`.
It is possible to refer to WMI objects from other namespaces such as `root/MicrosoftActiveDirectory`.
