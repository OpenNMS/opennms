|===

Another use of this policy is to mark interfaces for polling by the <<operation:deep-dive/snmp-poller/concepts.adoc#snmp-interface-poller, SNMP Interface Poller>>.
The SNMP Interface Poller is a separate daemon that is disabled by default.
For this daemon to do any work, some SNMP interfaces need to be selected for polling.

Use the `ENABLE_POLLING` and `DISABLE_POLLING` actions available in this policy to manage which SNMP interfaces this daemon polls.
