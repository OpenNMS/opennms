= Daemons

The {page-component-title} service is composed of several daemon "sub-services" that each perform a specific set of tasks.
They can be enabled/disabled via `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/service-configuration.xml`.

See the xref:operation:admin/daemon-config-files.adoc[system administration] section for details on sending daemon reload commands.
