= Daemons

The {page-component-title} service is composed of several daemon "sub-services" that each perform a specific set of tasks.
You can enable and disable them via `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/service-configuration.xml`.

See xref:operation:deep-dive/admin/configuration/daemon-config-files.adoc[] section for details on sending daemon reload commands.
