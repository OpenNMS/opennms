:description: Learn about scriptd, which transforms and enhances {page-component-title} events generated by other daemons.

Scriptd can transform and enhance {page-component-title} events that other daemons generate.
It can generate new events based on incoming data, enrich events with new data, and forward events as SNMP traps to external systems amongst other uses.
It enables better integration with external systems, based on data from sources internal and external to {page-component-title}.
