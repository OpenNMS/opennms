=== Actions

An automation action is designed to be a DML statement that can run against the result set of an automation trigger.
You can also set it to run independently.

Actions that process trigger results will usually require access to the data stored in the columns referenced by the trigger's DQL statement.
To let an action access this column data, use the `${<column name>}` format to specify the column.
For example, this action updates the severity of all alarms returned as the result of an escalation trigger:

[source, sql]
----
UPDATE alarms SET severity = least(7, severity+1)
 WHERE alarmid = ${alarmid}
   AND alarmAckUser is NULL
----
