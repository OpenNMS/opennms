:description: Learn about the OpenNMS {page-component-title} provision daemon (provisiond), which scans nodes from requisition and import files and from `newSuspect` events.

The provision daemon scans nodes from requisition and import files, and from `newSuspect` events.
The scanned nodes are then added to the database.
Note that only nodes in the database are monitored by other daemons.

`newSuspect` events are generated by discovery scans.
They can also be generated by trapd and syslogd, if those daemons are configured properly.
We recommend that you use the {page-component-title} web UI to update configuration settings.

== Provisiond thread configuration

Provisiond uses for a few thread pools to manage various tasks.
You can configure these via the Web UI by selecting menu:Info[External Requisitions] in the top menu bar.

NOTE: Any changes to the thread pools require a restart of the {page-component-title} service to apply the new thread limits.


.Provisiond thread pool descriptions
[cols="1,1,5"]
|===
| Pool  | Default Size | Description

| Import
| 8
| Number of threads to allocate for importing requisitions.
This pool determines the number of requisitions that can be imported at one time.
Increase this number if you have a large number of requisitions.

| Scan
| 10
| Number of threads to allocate for manual scan/sync requests.
This pool is used for any manual sync tasks and when requesting a rescan of a single node.
Increase this number if you have a large number of nodes in a single requisition.

| Rescan
| 10
| Number of threads to allocate for automated rescanning existing nodes.
This pool is used for rescanning nodes in a requisition on the schedule set in the foreign source definition.
This value typically should be the same as the Scan thread pool size.

| Write
| 8
| Number of threads to allocate for writing to the database.
This value typically does not need to be modified under most use cases.
