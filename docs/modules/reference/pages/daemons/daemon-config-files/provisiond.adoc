:description: Learn about the OpenNMS {page-component-title} provision daemon (provisiond), which scans nodes from requisition and import files and from `newSuspect` events.

The provision daemon scans nodes from requisition and import files, and from `newSuspect` events.
The scanned nodes are then added to the database.
Note that only nodes in the database are monitored by other daemons.

`newSuspect` events are generated by discovery scans.
They can also be generated by trapd and syslogd, if those daemons are configured properly.
We recommend that you use the {page-component-title} web UI to update configuration settings.
