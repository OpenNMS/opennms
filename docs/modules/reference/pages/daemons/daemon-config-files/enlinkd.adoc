= Enlinkd

The enhanced link daemon collects xref:operation:deep-dive/topology/enlinkd/introduction.adoc[topology information] via SNMP to determine connections between nodes.
The daemon essentially asks each device the following question: "What is the network topology, from your point of view?"

The enlinkd discovery process tries to discover bridge domain links using the data coming from all collected bridge forwarding tables.

The enlinkd topology updaters correlate all collected topology data and use it to generate a global topology map of your network.

=== Configuration

If multiple link discovery protocols are enabled, links will be discovered for each enabled protocol.
The xref:operation:deep-dive/topology/topology.adoc[topology map] visualizes links for each discovery protocol.
For example, if you start both the CDP and LLDP discovery protocols, the web UI visualizes a CDP link and an LLDP link.

Enhanced linkd supports a priority executor to collect SNMP data from devices.
Data collection is scheduled for each node and protocol and put into a priority executor running queue.
The data collection is performed according to the priority assigned.

Restart enlinkd or {page-component-title} to apply configuration changes.

WARNING: Specifying "false" with a `use-\{protocol}-discovery` attribute deletes persisted protocol data.

The first run of the bridge discovery process is scheduled for `initial_sleep_time + bridge_topology_interval`.
The first run of the updaters is scheduled for `0L`.
