= Enlinkd

The enhanced link daemon collects xref:operation:topology/enlinkd/introduction.adoc[topology information] via SNMP to determine neighboring nodes.
The daemon essentially asks each device the following question: "What is the network topology from your point of view?"
The enlinkd discovery process attempts to discover bridge domain links with the data coming from all collected bridge forwarding tables.
The enlinkd updaters correlate all collected topology data to generate a global topology layout of your network.

== Enlinkd configuration

If multiple protocols are enabled, links will be discovered for each enabled discovery protocol.
The topology web UI visualizes links for each discovery protocol.
For example, if you start CDP and LLDP discovery, the web UI visualizes a CDP link and an LLDP link.

Restart {page-component-title} or just the enlinkd daemon to apply configuration changes.
