= VmwareCimMonitor

This monitor is part of the VMware integration provided by Provisiond.
The monitor is specialized to test the health status provided from all host system (host) sensor data.

This monitor only runs on VMware hosts and only if the power state "on".
It does not apply to virtual machines.

This monitor requires hosts be imported with Provisiond and the VMware import.
{page-component-title} requires network access to VMware vCenter server and each of the monitored hosts.
The credentials for accessing the status of a VMware entity are collected from the responsible VMware vCenter using the settings from `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/vmware-config.xml`.
The VMware integration populates the following via Provisiond:

* VMware Management Server
* VMware Managed Entity Type
* foreignId (which contains an internal VMware vCenter Identifier)

The global health status is evaluated by testing all available host sensors and evaluating the state of each sensor.
A sensor state could be represented as the following:

* Unknown(0)
* OK(5)
* Degraded/Warning(10)
* Minor failure(15)
* Major failure(20)
* Critical failure(25)
* Non-recoverable error(30)

The service is up if all sensors have the status OK(5).
If any sensor gives a status other than OK(5), the service is marked as down.
The monitor error reason contains a list of all sensors that do not return status OK(5).

When using link:https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/techpaper/Distributed-Power-Management-vSphere.pdf[Distributed Power Management] (automatic PDF download), the standBy state forces a service down.
The health status is gathered with a direct connection to the host and in standby this connection is unavailable and the service is down.
To deal with standby states, use the ignoreStandBy parameter to consider the service as up when using distributed power management.
See the ignoreStandBy parameter below on how to change the state.
