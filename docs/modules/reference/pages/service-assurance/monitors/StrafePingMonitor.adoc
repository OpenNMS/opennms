= StrafePingMonitor

This monitor uses ICMP to monitor http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_delay_variation[packet delay variation] to a specific endpoint.
The main use case is to monitor a WAN endpoint and visualize packet loss and ICMP packet round-trip time deviation.
The StrafePingMonitor performs multiple ICMP echo requests (pings) and stores the response time of each as well as the packet loss.

This monitor is typically used on WAN connections and not activated for every ICMP-enabled device in your network.
Since StrafePingMonitor requires many more I/O requests than a single IcmpMonitor poll, use this monitor only where necessary to check packet loss.

== Examples

By default, you can find a separate poller package in `poller-configuration.xml` called `strafer`.
Configure the include-range or a filter to enable monitoring for devices with the service StrafePing.

The following example enables the monitoring for the StrafePing service on IP interfaces in the range `10.0.0.1` to `10.0.0.20`.
Additionally, you must assign the nodes to a node tag named `Latency`.

Example uses CentOS/RHEL path name.
For Debian/Ubuntu, use `/var/lib/opennms/rrd/response`.

Note that you must include the `monitor` section for each service in your definition.
