= JolokiaBeanMonitor

The JolokiaBeanMonitor is a JMX monitor specialized for the use with the link:http://www.jolokia.org[Jolokia framework].
Use the JolokiaBeanMonitor when you need to run a method via JMX or poll an attribute via JMX.
This monitor requires a fully installed and configured Jolokia agent deployed in the JVM container.
If required, you can provide attribute names, paths, and method parameters as additional arguments to the call.

To determine the status of the service, the JolokiaBeanMonitor relies on the output to be matched against a banner.
If the banner is part of the output, the status is interpreted as up; otherwise, it is considered down.
Banner matching supports regular expression and substring match.

kbd:[{}] _indicates the parameter supports <<reference:service-assurance/introduction.adoc#ref-service-assurance-monitors-placeholder-substitution-parameters, placeholder substitution>>._

NOTE: The attrname and methodname parameters are optional but one of them must be set.

This monitor implements the <<reference:service-assurance/introduction.adoc#ref-service-assurance-monitors-common-parameters, Common Configuration Parameters>>.

== AttrName versus MethodName

The JolokiaBeanMonitor has two modes of operation.
It can either scrape an attribute from a bean or run a method and compare output to a banner.
The method run is useful when your application has its own test methods that you would like to trigger via {page-component-title}.

Arguments to run a test method called "superTest" that take in a string as input:
[source, xml]
----
<parameter key="beanname" value="MyBean" />
<parameter key="methodname" value="superTest" />
<parameter key="input1" value="someString"/>
----

Arguments to scrape an attribute from the same bean:
[source, xml]
----
<parameter key="beanname" value="MyBean" />
<parameter key="attrname" value="upTime" />
----
