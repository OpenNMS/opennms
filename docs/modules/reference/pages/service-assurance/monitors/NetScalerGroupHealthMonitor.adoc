= NetScalerGroupHealthMonitor

This monitor is designed for Citrix(R) NetScaler(R) load-balancing checks.
It checks if more than x percent of the servers assigned to a specific group on a load-balanced service are active.
The required data is gathered via SNMP from the NetScaler.
The status of the servers is determined by the NetScaler.
The provided service itself is not part of the check.
A valid SNMP configuration in {page-component-title} for the NetScaler is required.

A NetScaler can manage several groups of servers per application.
This monitor just covers one group at a time.
To check multiple groups, define one monitor per group.

IMPORTANT: This monitor does not check the status of the load-balanced service itself.

== Examples

The following example checks a server group called central_webfront_http.
If at least 70% of the servers are active, the service is up.
If less then 70% of the servers are active, the service is down.
Use a configuration like the following in `poller-configuration.xml`:

[source, xml]
----
<service name="NetScaler_Health" interval="300000" user-defined="false" status="on">
   <parameter key="group-name" value="central_webfront_http" />
   <parameter key="group-health" value="70" />
</service>

<monitor service="NetScaler_Health" class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.poller.monitors.NetScalerGroupHealthMonitor" />
----

== Details about the used SNMP checks

The monitor checks the status of the server group based on the NS-ROOT-MIB using the svcGrpMemberState.
svcGrpMemberState is part of the serviceGroupMemberTable.
The serviceGroupMemberTable is indexed by svcGrpMemberGroupName and svcGrpMemberName.
An initial lookup for the group-name is performed.
Based on the lookup, the serviceGroupMemberTable is walked with the numeric representation of the server group.
The monitor interprets just the server status code `7-up` as active server.
Other status codes like `2-unknown` or `3-busy` are counted for the total amount of servers.
