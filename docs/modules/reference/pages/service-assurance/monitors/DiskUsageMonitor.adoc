= DiskUsageMonitor

The DiskUsageMonitor tests the amount of free space available on the specified storage disk of a monitored node.
The monitor inspects the http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1514[HOST-RESOURCES-MIB] hrStorageTable to get information about the available free storage space.

A disk's description (as found in the corresponding `hrStorageDescr` object) must match the criteria the `disk` and `match-type` parameters specify to be monitored.
The available free space is calculated using the corresponding hrStorageSize and hrStorageUsed objects.

CAUTION: The hrStorageUsed does not account for filesystem reserved blocks (for example, for the super-user), so DiskUsageMonitor will report the service as unavailable only when the amount of free disk space is actually lower than `free` minus the percentage of reserved filesystem blocks.

This monitor uses SNMP to accomplish its work.
Therefore, systems against which you use it must have an SNMP agent supporting the HOST-RESOURCES-MIB installed and configured.
Most modern SNMP agents, including most distributions of the Net-SNMP agent and the SNMP service that ships with Microsoft Windows, support this MIB.
Out-of-the-box support for HOST-RESOURCES-MIB among commercial Unix operating systems may be spotty.

== Configuration and use

.Monitor-specific parameters for the DiskUsageMonitor
[options="header"]
[cols="1,4a,2"]
|===
| Parameter
| Description
| Default

3+|*Required*

| disk
| A pattern that a storage's description (`hrStorageDescr`) must match to be taken into account.
| n/a

3+|*Optional*

| free
| The minimum amount of free space that storage matching the criteria must have available.
This parameter is evaluated as a percent of the storage's reported maximum capacity.
| 15

| match-type
| The way the pattern specified by the disk parameter must be compared to the storage's description.
Must be one of the following symbolic operators:

* **endswith**: The disk parameter's value is evaluated as a string that the storage's description must end with.
* **exact**: The disk parameter's value is evaluated as a string that the storage's description must exactly match.
* **regex**: The disk parameter's value is evaluated as a regular expression that the storage's description must match.
* **startswith**: The disk parameter's value is evaluated as a string that storage's description must start with.

Note that comparisons are case-sensitive.
| exact

| port
| Destination port where the SNMP requests are sent.
| From snmp-config.xml

| retries
| Deprecated.
Same as `retry`.
Parameter retry takes precedence when both are set.
|From snmp-config.xml

This monitor implements the <<reference:service-assurance/introduction.adoc#ref-service-assurance-monitors-common-parameters, Common Configuration Parameters>>.

== Examples

Note that you must include the `monitor` section for each service in your definition.

== DiskUsageMonitor versus thresholds

You can also use thresholds to monitor a storage's available free space if you are already collecting these data.
The difference between thresholds and this monitor is that while both can trigger notifications, using this monitor will put the node into a service down state and trigger an outage.
