= SnmpMonitor

The SNMP monitor provides a common platform to monitor states and results from SNMP agents.
This monitor has two basic operation modes:

* Test the response value of one specific OID (scalar object identifier)
* Test multiple values in a whole table

To decide which mode to use, use the `walk` and `match-all` parameters.

The _Operating mode selection_ and _Monitor specific parameters for the SnmpMonitor_ tables below provide more information about these operation modes.

When the monitor is configured to persist the response time, it counts the total amount of time spent until it obtains a successful one, including the retries.
It stores the entire poll time, not just the time spent during the last successful attempt.

== Configuration and use

.Optional monitor-specific parameters for the SnmpMonitor
[options="header"]
[cols="1,3a,2"]
|===
| Parameter
| Description
| Default

| hex
| Specifies that the value monitored should be compared against its hexadecimal representation.
Useful when the monitored value is a string containing non-printable characters.
| false

| match-all
| Can be set to:

* `count`: specifies that the value of at least minimum and at most maximum objects encountered in
the walk must match the criteria specified by `operand` and `operator`.
* `true` (and `walk` is set to `true`): specifies that the value of every object encountered in
the walk must match the criteria specified by the `operand` and `operator` parameters.
* `false` (and `walk` is set to `true`): specifies that the value of any object encountered in
the walk must match the criteria specified by the `operand` and `operator` parameters.
| true

| maximum
| Valid only when match-all is set to `count`, otherwise ignored.
Use in conjunction with the `minimum` parameter.
Specifies that the value of at most `maximum` objects
encountered in the walk must meet the criteria specified by the `operand` and `operator` parameters.
| 0

| minimum
| Valid only when match-all is set to `count`, otherwise ignored.
Use in conjunction with the `maximum` parameter.
Specifies that the value of at least `minimum` objects encountered in the walk must meet the criteria the `operand` and `operator` parameters specify.
| 0

| oid
| The object identifier of the MIB object to monitor.
If no other parameters are present, the monitor asserts that the agent's response for this object must include a valid value (as opposed to an error, no-such-name, or end-of-view condition) that is non-null.
| .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0 (SNMPv2-MIB::SysObjectID)

| operand
| The value to compare against the observed value of the monitored object.
Note: Comparison will always succeed if either the `operand` or `operator` parameter isn't set and the monitored value is non-null.
| n/a

| operator
| The operator to use for comparing the monitored object against the operand parameter.
Must be one of the following symbolic operators:

* `&amp;lt;`: Less than (<).
Both operand and observed object value must be numeric.
* `&amp;gt;`: Greater than (>).
Both operand and observed object value must be numeric.
* `&amp;lt;=`: Less than or equal to (<=).
Both operand and observed object value must be numeric.
* `&amp;gt;=`: Greater than or equal to (>=).
Both operand and observed object value must be numeric.
* `=`: Equal to.
Applied in numeric context if both operand and observed object value are numeric, otherwise in string context as a case-sensitive exact match.
* `!=`: Not equal to.
Applied in numeric context if both operand and observed object value are numeric, otherwise in string context as a case-sensitive exact non-match.
* `~`:  Regular expression match.
Always applied in string context.

Note: Comparison will always succeed if either the operand or operator parameter isn't set and the monitored value is non-null.
Keep in mind that you need to escape all < and > characters as XML entities (`&amp;lt;` and `&amp;gt;` respectively).
| n/a

| port
| Destination port where the SNMP requests are sent.
| from `snmp-config.xml`

| reason-template
| A user-provided template used for the monitor's reason code if the service is unavailable.
Defaults to a reasonable value if unset.
See below for an explanation of the possible template parameters.
| depends on operation mode

| retries
| *Deprecated* Same as retry.
Parameter retry takes precedence if both are set.
| from `snmp-config.xml`

| walk
| `false`: Sets the monitor to poll for a scalar object unless the match-all parameter is set to `count`, in which case the match-all parameter takes precedence. +
`true`: Sets the monitor to poll for a tabular object where the match-all parameter defines how the tabular object's values must match the criteria defined by the operator and operand parameters.
See also the match-all, minimum, and maximum parameters.
| false

== Example: monitoring a scalar object

As a working example, we want to monitor the thermal system fan status which is provided as a scalar object ID.

 cpqHeThermalSystemFanStatus .1.3.6.1.4.1.232.6.2.6.4.0

The manufacturer MIB gives the following information:

.Description of the cpqHeThermalSystemFanStatus from https://www.circitor.fr/Mibs/Mib/C/CPQHLTH-MIB.mib[CPQHLTH-MIB]
[source, snmp-mib]
----
SYNTAX 	INTEGER  {
    other    (1),
    ok       (2),
    degraded (3),
    failed   (4)
}
ACCESS 	read-only
DESCRIPTION
"The status of the fan(s) in the system.

This value will be one of the following:
other(1)
Fan status detection is not supported by this system or driver.

ok(2)
All fans are operating properly.

degraded(3)
A non-required fan is not operating properly.

failed(4)
A required fan is not operating properly.

If the cpqHeThermalDegradedAction is set to shutdown(3) the
system will be shutdown if the failed(4) condition occurs."
----

The SnmpMonitor is configured to test if the fan status returns `ok(2)`.
If so, the service is marked as up.
Any other value indicates a problem with the thermal fan status and marks the service down.

Note that you must include the `monitor` section for each service in your definition.

== Example: test SNMP table with all matching values

The second mode shows how to monitor the values of a whole SNMP table.
As a practical use case, the status of a set of physical drives is monitored.
This example configuration shows the status monitoring from the http://www.circitor.fr/Mibs/Html/C/CPQIDA-MIB.php[CPQIDA-MIB].

We use the physical drive status given by the following tabular OID as a scalar object ID:

`cpqDaPhyDrvStatus .1.3.6.1.4.1.232.3.2.5.1.1.6`

    predictiveFailure (4)
}
ACCESS 	read-only
DESCRIPTION
Physical Drive Status.
This shows the status of the physical drive.
The following values are valid for the physical drive status:

other (1)
 Indicates that the instrument agent does not recognize
 the drive.  You may need to upgrade your instrument agent
 and/or driver software.

ok (2)
 Indicates the drive is functioning properly.

failed (3)
 Indicates that the drive is no longer operating and
 should be replaced.

predictiveFailure(4)
 Indicates that the drive has a predictive failure error and
 should be replaced.
----

The configuration in our monitor tests all physical drives for status `ok(2)`.

== Example: test SNMP table with some matching values

This example shows how to use the SnmpMonitor to test if the number of static routes are within a given boundary.
The service is marked as up if at least three and at maximum of 10 static routes are set on a network device.
This status can be monitored by polling the table ipRouteProto from the http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1213.txt[RFC1213-MIB2].

`ipRouteProto 1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.9`

The MIB description provides the following information:

ACCESS 	read-only
DESCRIPTION
"The routing mechanism via which this route was learned.
Inclusion of values for gateway routing protocols is not
intended to imply that hosts should support those protocols."
----

To monitor only local routes, apply the test only on entries in the ipRouteProto table with value `2`.
The number of entries in the whole ipRouteProto table has to be counted and the boundaries on the number has to be applied.

.Example SnmpMonitor used to test if the number of local static route entries is between 3 and 10
