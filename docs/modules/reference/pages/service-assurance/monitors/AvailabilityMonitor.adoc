= AvailabilityMonitor

NOTE: This monitor has been superseded by the <<service-assurance/monitors/IcmpMonitor.adoc#poller-icmp-monitor, IcmpMonitor>>.

This monitor uses the isReachable method of the InetAddress Java class to test the reachability of a node.
The service is considered available if isReachable returns true.
See link:https://docs.w3cub.com/openjdk~11/java.base/java/net/inetaddress.html#isReachable(int)[Oracle's documentation] for more details.

Note that under most configurations the <<service-assurance/monitors/IcmpMonitor.adoc#poller-icmp-monitor, IcmpMonitor>> supersedes the AvailabilityMonitor.
The AvailabilityMonitor was developed when the IcmpMonitor was not remote enabled, to circumvent this limitation.
Now, with the JNA ICMP implementation, the IcmpMonitor is remote-enabled under most configurations, so you should not need the AvailabilityMonitor.
