= VmwareMonitor

This monitor is part of the VMWare integration that provisiond provides.
It tests the power state of a virtual machine or host system.
If the power state is `poweredOn`, the service is considered to be up; if it is `poweredOff`, the service is marked as down.
By default, a power state of `standBy` will also mark the service as down.

If you use https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/techpaper/Distributed-Power-Management-vSphere.pdf[Distributed Power Management] (automatic PDF download), you can change the `standBy` state (see the `ignoreStandBy` parameter).

Optionally, a service down event can be triggered if there are pending alarms in vCenter that have not been acknowledged or cleared.

== Import hosts

The VmwareMonitor requires that hosts be imported using provisiond and the VMware import function.
{page-component-title} requires network access to the VMWare vCenter server and each of the monitored hosts.

The credentials for accessing the status of a VMware entity are collected from the appropriate vCenter instance using settings from `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/vmware-config.xml`.
This file also sets specific asset fields to be assigned to imported virtual machines and host systems.

The VMware integration populates the following asset fields via provisiond:

* VMware Management Server
* VMware Managed Entity Type
* `foreignId` (which contains an internal VMware vCenter Identifier)

For more information, see xref:reference:/provisioning/handlers/vmware.adoc[].

.Optional monitor-specific parameters
[options="autowidth"]
|===
| Parameter | Description | Default Value

| retry
| Number of retries before the service is marked as down.
| 0

| ignoreStandBy
| Treat the `standBy` power state as an indicator that a service is up.
| false

| reportAlarms
| Check for unacknowledged vSphere alarms for a comma-separated list of <<operation:deep-dive/events/event-configuration.adoc#severities, severities>> (red, yellow, green, gray).
| _Blank_
|===

This monitor implements the <<reference:service-assurance/introduction.adoc#ref-service-assurance-monitors-common-parameters, common configuration parameters>>.

== Example

The following is an example of a `poller-configuration.xml` VmwareMonitor configuration.
With these settings, the monitor will go down if any unacknowledged vSphere alarms with either red or yellow severities exist for the managed entity:

Note that you must include the `monitor` section for each service in your definition.
