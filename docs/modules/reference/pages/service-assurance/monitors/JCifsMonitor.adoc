= JCifsMonitor

This monitor lets you to test a file-sharing service based on the CIFS/SMB protocol.

IMPORTANT: The use of the JCifsMonitor requires the installation of the `opennms-plugin-protocol-cifs` package before polling will start.

****
To install the opennms-plugin-protocol-cifspackage:

* For RPM-based distributions:
** `yum install opennms-plugin-protocol-cifs`
* For Debian-based distributions:
** `apt-get install opennms-plugin-protocol-cifs`
****

With the JCifsMonitor, you can run tests for the following use cases:

* share is available in the network
* a given file exists in the share
* a given folder exists in the share
* a given folder should contain at least one (1) file
* a given folder folder should contain no (0) files

By testing on files and folders, you can use a regular expression to ignore specific file and folder names from the test.

A network resource in SMB is a file or folder addressed as a UNC Path.

 \\server\share\folder\file.txt

The Java implementation jCIFS, which implements the CIFS/SMB network protocol, uses SMB URLs to access the network resource.
The same resource as in our example would look like this as an link:http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/smb[SMB URL]:

 smb://workgroup;user:password@server/share/folder/file.txt

The JCifsMonitor cannot test the following:

* if a file contains specific content
* a specific number of files in a folder; for example, folder should contain exactly/more or less than x files
* age or modification time stamps of files or folders
* permissions or other attributes of files or folders

== Configuration and use

.Monitor-specific parameters for the JCifsMonitor
[options="header"]
[cols="1,3,2"]
|===
| Parameter
| Description
| Default

3+|*Required*

| path
| Path to the resource you want to test.
| empty string

3+|*Optional*

| retry
| Number of retries before the service is marked as down.
| 0

| domain kbd:[{}]
| Windows domain where the user is located.
You don't have to use the domain parameter if you use local user accounts.
| empty string

| username kbd:[{}]
| Username to access the resource over a network.
| empty string

| password kbd:[{}]
| Password for the user
| empty string

| mode
| The test mode which has the following options: +
`path_exist`: Service is up if the resource is accessible +
`path_not_exist`: Service is up if the resource is not accessible +
`folder_empty`: Service is up if the folder is empty (0 files) +
`qwafolder_not_empty`: Service is up if the folder has at least one file
| path_exist

| smbHost
| Override the IP address of the SMB URL to check shares on different file servers.
| empty string

| folderIgnoreFiles
| Ignore specific files in folder with regular expression.
This parameter be applied only on folder_empty and folder_not_empty; otherwise, it is ignored.
| n/a
|===

kbd:[{}] _indicates the parameter supports <<reference:service-assurance/introduction.adoc#ref-service-assurance-monitors-placeholder-substitution-parameters, placeholder substitution>>._

CAUTION: Due to limitations in the JCifs library, only global timeouts can be used reliably.

This monitor implements the <<reference:service-assurance/introduction.adoc#ref-service-assurance-monitors-common-parameters, Common Configuration Parameters>>.

TIP: It makes little sense to have retries higher than 1, as it is a waste of resources during monitoring. +
If you access shares with Mac OSX, you may have some side effects with the hidden file `.DS_Store.`
If it gives you false positives in monitoring, use the folderIgnoreFiles parameter.

== Example test: existence of a file

This example shows how to configure the JCifsMonitor to test if a file share is available over a network.
For this example, we have access to a share for error logs and we want to get an outage if we have any error log files in our folder.
The share is named _log_.
The service should go back to normal if the error log file is deleted and the folder is empty.

.JCifsMonitor configuration to test that a shared folder is empty

Note that you must include the `monitor` section for each service in your definition.
