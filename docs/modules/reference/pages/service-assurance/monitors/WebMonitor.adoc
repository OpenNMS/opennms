= WebMonitor

WebMonitor is a clone of <<service-assurance/monitors/HttpMonitor.adoc#poller-http-monitor, HttpMonitor>>, that uses a different underlying library for doing HTTP connections.
WebMonitor uses Apache HttpClient, which acts more like a real browser (follows redirects, and so on) than HttpMonitor.
