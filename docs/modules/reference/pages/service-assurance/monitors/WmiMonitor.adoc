= WmiMonitor

The WMI monitor tests the availability of WMI services on remote interfaces.

NOTE: xref:reference:service-assurance/monitors/WsManMonitor.adoc[WSMAN] does everything that WMI does and is a more modern protocol for Windows monitoring.

== Configuration and use

Note that username, password, and domain credentials defined here override any defined in the wmi-config file.
Best practice is to put credentials there instead of in the pollerd/collectd configuration.

[cols="1,3a,1"]
|===
| Parameter
| Description
| Default

| username
| The username to use when authenticating against the WMI host.
| none

| password
| The password to use when authenticating against the WMI host.
| none

| domain
| Windows domain where the user is located.
You do not have to use the domain parameter if you use local user accounts.
| none

| matchType
| Tells the OpenNMS WMI system to deal with multiple instance results.
Available match types are:

* *all*: all instances must comply to the compare operation.
* *none*: no instances should comply with the compare operation.
* *some*: only some (one or more) must comply with the compare operation.
* *one*: only one instance can comply with the compare operation.
| all

| wmiClass
| Class of instances within WMI.
This class contains objects representing properties and methods available.
| Win32_ComputerSystem

| wmiObject
| Member of a WMI property set.
For example, the `Win32_ComputerSystem` class contains properties that we can look at and poll.
The default "WMI" service uses the "Status" property to determine if the system is running and if WMI is available.
| Status

| compareOp
| The compare operation tells the OpenNMS WMI poller plugins how to verify the nature (up, critical) of a specific property within WMI.
In the event of unequal comparisons, the system will always have the WMI value (as retrieved from the target) on the left.
Available compare operations are:

* *EQ* (equals)
* *NEQ* (not equals)
* *GT* (greater than)
* *LT* (less than)
* *NOOP* (no operation)

The NOOP operation is a special case which always evaluates to a result code of "OK."
| EQ

| compareValue
| The value to use when performing a comparison against the wmiObject.
| OK

| service-name
| Name of the service to monitor.
 If there is a ~ at the beginning of the parameter, the rest of the string will be used as a regular expression pattern match, otherwise it will be considered an exact match.
| WMI

| retry
| Number of retries before the service is marked as down.
| 0

| timeout
| Time in milliseconds to wait for a response.
|

| namespace
| Every WMI class exists in a namespace.
The default namespace for most common classes is root/cimv2.
It is possible to refer to WMI objects from other namespaces such as root/MicrosoftActiveDirectory.
| root/cimv2

== Example

The following example shows how to enable monitoring that already discovered WMI services are still running.

Note that you must include the `monitor` section for each service in your definition.
