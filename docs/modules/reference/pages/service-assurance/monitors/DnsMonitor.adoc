= DnsMonitor

This monitor tests the availability of the DNS service on remote IP interfaces.
A DNS query is sent to check for a response of either an A or AAAA resource record.

The monitor is marked as up if it receives a valid response from the DNS Server.
For hostnames that have multiple resource records, it is possible to test if the number of responses are within a given boundary.

The monitor can be simulated with the command line tool `host`:

[source, console]
----
~ % host -v -t a www.google.com 8.8.8.8
Trying "www.google.com"

TIP: This monitor is intended for testing the availability of a DNS service.
To monitor the DNS resolution of some of your nodes from a client's perspective, use the <<service-assurance/monitors/DNSResolutionMonitor.adoc#poller-dns-resolution-monitor,DNSResolutionMonitor>>.

== DnsMonitor versus DNSResolutionMonitor

The DnsMonitor is a test against a specific DNS server.
Use this service to determine if the monitored node provides DNS resolution of requests sent to it.
In {page-component-title}, the DNS server is the node and the DnsMonitor sends a lookup request for a given A record to the DNS server IP address.
The service goes down if the DNS server doesn't have a valid A record in its zone database or has other issues resolving A records.

The <<service-assurance/monitors/DNSResolutionMonitor.adoc#poller-dns-resolution-monitor, DNSResolutionMonitor>> measures the availability and record outages of hostname resolution from a client perspective.
Use this service to determine if the monitored node can be resolved by DNS hosted somewhere else in your network.

== Example

This example shows how to monitor whether the IP interface from a given DNS server resolves a DNS request.
This service should be bound to a DNS server which should be able to give a valid DNS response for a request to `www.google.com`.
The service is up if the DNS server gives between one and ten A record responses.

Note that you must include the `monitor` section for each service in your definition.

To have response time graphs for the name resolution, you must configure RRD graphs for the given ds-names (`dns-res-v4`, `dns-res-v6`, `dns-res-both`, `dns-res-either`, `dns-res-cname-mx`) in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/response-graph.properties`.
