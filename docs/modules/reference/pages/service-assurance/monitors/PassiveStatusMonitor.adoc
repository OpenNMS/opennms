= PassiveStatusMonitor

Passive nodes are nodes that {page-component-title} is unable to directly communicate with because either they are 'not real' or because there is no network path directly to the device.
They are termed 'Passive' because {page-component-title} cannot actively poll them and instead passively relies on information sent from somewhere else.

== PassiveStatusKeeper
It is the job of the PassiveStatusKeeper to maintain the status of passive services in memory with a hash table.
The PassiveStatusMonitor is called by pollerd, just as the other IP based monitors.
However, its behavior is to report the status currently represented in the PassiveStatusKeeper's hash table.
No polling on the network is performed.
This hash table will either contain the latest status reported by a passive status event, or, if no status messages have been received, the PassiveStatusKeeper defaults to status "Up".

During {page-component-title} initialization, the outages database table is queried to set the initial state of any passive service based on the last known outage condition when services previously stopped.


== Passive Status Events
The PassiveStatusKeeper updates its hash table when a `uei.opennms.org/services/passiveServiceStatus` is processed.
The event must have the following parameters included.

passiveNodeLabel::
Must be exactly the same as node name in OpenNMS and is case sensitive.
passiveIpAddr::
The IP interface of the node with a PassiveStatusMonitor service
passiveServiceName::
The name of the PassiveStatusMonitor service.
passiveStatus::
Must be either `Up` or `Down` and is case sensitive.
passiveReasonCode::
Optional field typically only present in down events that can be used to enrich the event with specific information regarding the reason for the service down event.

Any event with this specific UEI and parameter set will trigger a PassiveStatusKeeper update.
If sending events directly from an external system such as via xref:operation:events/sources/rest.adoc[REST] or xref:operation:events/sources/kafka.adoc[Kafka Consumer], the event can directly be sent with these parameters for Eventd to process.
If you will be extracting passive status updates from traps or syslog messages, the xref:operation:events/event-translator.adoc#ga-event-translator-psk[event translator] can be used to generate the `uei.opennms.org/services/passiveServiceStatus` events.

== Configuration and Use

There are no specific parameters for configuring the PassiveStatusMonitor.


== Examples

If you will only have one service to monitor passively, a basic service can be set in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/pollerd-configuration.xml`.

[source, xml]
----
<service name="PassiveStatus" interval="60000" user-defined="true" status="on"><1>
</service>
<monitor service="PassiveStatus" class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.poller.monitors.PassiveServiceMonitor" />
----
<1> As the monitor checks the PassiveStatusKeeper table in memory, small interval times will allow for quick responses to updates with minimal overhead.
Interval times of 30 seconds to 60 seconds (as used in this example) are typical for this type of monitor.



If you will have multiple passive monitors, using xref:operation:service-assurance/polling-packages.adoc#ga-pollerd-packages-patterns[service patterns] can make configuration easy.
With the following example, any service added to a node that matches the wildcard "Passive-*" will match a PassiveStatusKeeper update event for the matching `passiveServiceName` parameter.

[source, xml]
----
<service name="Passive-" interval="60000" user-defined="true" status="on">
    <pattern><![CDATA[^Passive-(?<name>.*)$]]></pattern>
</service>
<monitor service="Passive-" class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.poller.monitors.PassiveServiceMonitor" />
