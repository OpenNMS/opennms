= Mail Notifications 

`javaEmail` and `javaPagerEmail`::
    By far the most commonly used commands, these deliver a notice to a user's `email` or `pagerEmail` contact field value.
    By configuring a user's `pagerEmail` contact field value to target an email-to-SMS gateway, SMS notifications are trivially easy to configure.
    Both are implemented using the in-process JavaMail notification strategy.
