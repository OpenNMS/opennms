= Notification Commands

This section describes all available built-in ref:operation:notifications/introduction.adoc[notification] commands.
Notification commands are customizable and extensible by editing the `notificationCommands.xml` file.

For information on how to extend the functionality of these commands, see the xref:development:overview/overview.adoc#overview[Development section] to contribute to the project.

NOTE: Use external binary notification commands sparingly to avoid fork-bombing your {page-component-title} system.
Note that the `numericPage` and `textPage` commands use external programs to do their work.
