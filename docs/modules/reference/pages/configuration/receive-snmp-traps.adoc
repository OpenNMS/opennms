= Receive SNMP traps/informs

{page-component-title} lets you receive and process SNMP traps and informs out of the box.
The {page-component-title} services run as an unprivileged user and cannot bind on port numbers below `1024` without escalated privileges.
For this reason, the default port for the SNMP trap/inform listener is set to `10162/udp` instead of the IANA registered port number `162/udp`.
The following example shows how to configure the local firewall daemon to forward port `162/udp` to `10162/udp`.

NOTE: If you need the SNMP trap listener on port `162/udp` directly, see xref:deployment:core/getting-started.adoc#set-up-core-instance[Binding to privileged ports].

You can verify your firewall and port forwarding configuration by sending an SNMP trap from a remote system to your {page-component-title} instance:

[source, console]
snmptrap -v 2c -c public opennms-core-host '' 1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.991.17 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6.0 s "Milky Way" <1><2>

<1> By default, {page-component-title} uses the `public` community string.
If you changed the community string in {page-component-title}, use the updated name here.
<2> Replace `opennms-core-host` with your {page-component-title} instance's IP or FQDN.

NOTE: On RHEL and CentOS, the `snmptrap` command line tool is part of the `net-snmp-utils`.
If you run on Debian or Ubuntu, the tool is part of the `snmp-utils` package.

To verify your configuration, look for an SNMP trap event in the {page-component-title} web UI:

. Sign in to the web UI.
. Click menu:Status[Events].
. Under Event Queries, select *All Events*.
. Search the list for a `uei.opennms.org/generic/traps/EnterpriseDefault` event from your test host.
