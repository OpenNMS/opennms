= File Editor: Manage Configuration Files from the UI

The File Editor, available in the new UI, allow users to view and edit configuration files (`.xml`, `.cfg`, `.drl`, etc.) with the OpenNMS UI instead of having to edit them directly in the file system (for example in the `/etc` directory).

NOTE: Making changes to configuration files will affect how OpenNMS operates and that incorrectly editing a file could result in features no longer working or not working as intended.

To access the File Editor, go to the new UI, for example by clicking on "UI Preview", then navigating to "File Editor".

== Viewing Files

After navigating to the File Editor, a tree view of the OpenNMS `/etc` directory is displayed.

From here you can navigate to any configuration file

- navigate to any file
- expand and collapse subtrees
- search for any part of a file or directory name
- view and edit files

## Editing Files

To edit a file, simply start typing within the file text display.

To save the file, click "Save".

CAUTION: This will overwrite the file on disk, there is no versioning or backup file support at this time.

Use the "Reset" button to reload the file from disk into the editor - this will be the text as it was last saved to disk, not necessarily the original text before you began any editing.

## Add Files

To add a new file, navigate to a folder and click the plus `+` sign.

Enter a file name and add some text, then click "Save" to save the file.

Note, validation will run when you attempt to save the file and may prevent it from being saved. A message will appear at the bottom of the text editor with more information on why validation failed.

To delete a file, click on the minus sign `-` to the right of the file name. A confirmation dialog will be displayed, click "Confirm" to delete the file or "Cancel" to cancel the action.

CAUTION: Deleting a file is permanent, the file will be removed from disk and is unrecoverable.

## Activating the Changes

To activate any changes made in the File Editor, you may need to restart OpenNMS.

## Console

After performing actions such as "Save" or "Delete", a Console window will appear at the bottom of the edit pane with some detailed information about actions.

You can click "Clear" to clear the Console text or "Minimize" to minimize the Console window.
