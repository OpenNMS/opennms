= Collectors

This section describes all available built-in xref:operation:deep-dive/performance-data-collection/introduction.adoc[performance data collectors].
You can configure them to allow complex monitoring to meet the needs of your environment.
You can use xref:operation:deep-dive/meta-data.adoc#ga-meta-data-dsl[Metadata-DSL] to dynamically interpolate metadata into parameter values during the collection process.

For information on how to extend the functionality of these monitors, see the xref:development:development.adoc#development[Development section] to contribute to the project.
