= WsManCollector

The WsManCollector collects performance metrics using the Web Services-Management (WS-Management) protocol.

WS-Management is a Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) open standard that defines a SOAP-based protocol for the management of servers, devices, applications, and web services.
Windows Remote Management (WinRM) is the Microsoft implementation of WS-Management Protocol.

== WS-Management setup

Before setting up {page-component-title} to communicate with a WS-Management agent, you should confirm that it is properly configured and reachable from the {page-component-title} system.
If you need help to enable the WS-Management agent, consult the manufacturer's documentation.
Here are some resources that could help:

* https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa384372(v=vs.85).aspx[Installation and Configuration for Windows Remote Management]
* http://www.hurryupandwait.io/blog/understanding-and-troubleshooting-winrm-connection-and-authentication-a-thrill-seekers-guide-to-adventure[Troubleshooting WinRM connection and authentication]

We suggest using the https://github.com/Openwsman/openwsman/wiki/openwsman-command-line-client[Openwsman command line client] to validate authentication and connectivity.
Packages are available for most distributions under `wsmancli`.

For example:

[source, shell]
----
wsman identify -h localhost -P 5985 -u wsman -p secret
----

Once validated, add the agent-specific details to the {page-component-title} configuration, defined in the next section.

=== Troubleshooting and commands

For troubleshooting, there is a set of commands you can use in Powershell, verified on Microsoft Windows Server 2012.

.Enable WinRM in PowerShell
[source, shell]
----
Enable-PSRemoting
----

.Set up Firewall for WinRM over HTTP
[source, shell]
----
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="WinRM-HTTP" dir=in localport=5985 protocol=TCP action=allow
----

.Set up Firewall for WinRM over HTTPS
[source, shell]
----
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="WinRM-HTTPS" dir=in localport=5986 protocol=TCP action=allow
----

.Test WinRM on local Windows Server
[source, shell]
----
winrm id
----

.Show WinRM configuration on Windows Server
[source, shell]
----
winrm get winrm/config
----

.Show listener for configuration on Windows Server
[source, shell]
----
winrm e winrm/config/listener
----

.Test connectivity from a Linux system
[source, shell]
----
nc -z -w1 <windows-server-ip-or-host> 5985;echo $?
----

IMPORTANT: Use BasicAuthentication just with WinRM over HTTPS with verifiable certificates in production environment.

.Enable BasicAuthentication
[source, shell]
----
winrm set winrm/config/client/auth '@{Basic="true"}'
winrm set winrm/config/service/auth '@{Basic="true"}'
winrm set winrm/config/service '@{AllowUnencrypted="true"}'

[[ga-performance-mgmt-collectors-wsman-agent-config]]
== WS-Management agent configuration

Understanding xref:operation:deep-dive/performance-data-collection/resource-types.adoc#resource-types[resource types] helps when editing collector-specific configuration files.

The agent-specific configuration details are maintained in `etc/wsman-config.xml`.
This file has a similar structure as `etc/snmp-config.xml`, which you may already be familiar with.

This file is consulted when a connection to a WS-Man Agent is made.
If the IP address of the agent is matched by the `range`, `specific`, or `ip-match` elements of a definition, then the attributes on that definition are used to connect to the agent.
Otherwise, the attributes on the outer `wsman-config` definition are used.

The `etc/wsman-config.xml` files automatically reload when modified.

Here is an example with several definitions:

[source, xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<wsman-config retry="3" timeout="1500" ssl="true" strict-ssl="false" path="/wsman">
    <definition ssl="true" strict-ssl="false" path="/wsman" username="root" password="calvin" product-vendor="Dell" product-version="iDRAC 6">
        <range begin="192.168.1.1" end="192.168.1.10"/>
    </definition>
    <definition ssl="false" port="5985" path="/wsman" username="Administrator" password="P@ssword">
        <ip-match>172.23.1-4.1-255</ip-match>
        <specific>172.23.1.105</specific>
    </definition>
</wsman-config>
----

|===

NOTE: If you try to connect against Microsoft Windows Server, make sure to set specific ports for WinRM connections.
By default, Microsoft Windows Server uses port `TCP/5985` for plain text and port `TCP/5986` for SSL connections.

== WS-Management collection configuration

Configuration for the WS-Management collector is stored in `etc/wsman-datacollection-config.xml` and `etc/wsman-datacollection.d/*.xml`.

NOTE: The contents of these files are automatically merged and reloaded when changed.
The following shows the default WS-Management collection:

[source, xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<wsman-datacollection-config rrd-repository="$OPENNMS_HOME/share/rrd/snmp/">
    <collection name="default">
        <rrd step="300">
            <rra>RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1:2016</rra>
            <rra>RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:12:1488</rra>
            <rra>RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:288:366</rra>
            <rra>RRA:MAX:0.5:288:366</rra>
            <rra>RRA:MIN:0.5:288:366</rra>
        </rrd>

        <!--
            Include all of the available system definitions
        -->
        <include-all-system-definitions/>
    </collection>
</wsman-datacollection-config>
----

The magic happens with the `<include-all-system-definitions/>` element that automatically includes all of the system definitions into the collection group.

NOTE: If required, you can include a specific system-definition with `<include-system-definition>sys-def-name</include-system-definition>`.

You can define system definitions and related groups in the root `etc/wsman-datacollection-config.xml` file, but it is preferable to add them to device-specific configuration files in `etc/wsman-datacollection-config.d/*.xml`.

TIP: Avoid modifying any of the distribution configuration files. Create new ones to store your specific details instead.

Here is an example configuration file for a Dell iDRAC:

[source, xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<wsman-datacollection-config>
    <group name="drac-system"
            resource-uri="http://schemas.dell.com/wbem/wscim/1/cim-schema/2/root/dcim/DCIM_ComputerSystem"
            resource-type="node">
        <attrib name="OtherIdentifyingInfo" index-of="#IdentifyingDescriptions matches '.*ServiceTag'" alias="serviceTag" type="String"/>
    </group>

    <group name="drac-power-supply"
            resource-uri="http://schemas.dmtf.org/wbem/wscim/1/*"
            dialect="http://schemas.microsoft.com/wbem/wsman/1/WQL"
            filter="select InputVoltage,InstanceID,PrimaryStatus,SerialNumber,TotalOutputPower from DCIM_PowerSupplyView where DetailedState != 'Absent'"
            resource-type="dracPowerSupplyIndex">
        <attrib name="InputVoltage" alias="inputVoltage" type="Gauge"/>
        <attrib name="InstanceID" alias="instanceId" type="String"/>
        <attrib name="PrimaryStatus" alias="primaryStatus" type="Gauge"/>
        <attrib name="SerialNumber" alias="serialNumber" type="String"/>
        <attrib name="TotalOutputPower" alias="totalOutputPower" type="Gauge"/>
    </group>

    <system-definition name="Dell iDRAC (All Version)">
        <rule>#productVendor matches '^Dell.*' and #productVersion matches '.*iDRAC.*'</rule>
        <include-group>drac-system</include-group>
        <include-group>drac-power-supply</include-group>
    </system-definition>
</wsman-datacollection-config>
----

[[ga-performance-mgmt-collectors-wsman-system-definitions]]
=== System definitions

Rules in the system definition are written using http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/expressions.html[SpEL] expressions.

The expression has access to the following variables in its evaluation context:

[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Name           | Type
| (root)         | org.opennms.netmgt.model.OnmsNode
| agent          | org.opennms.netmgt.collection.api.CollectionAgent
| productVendor  | java.lang.String
| productVersion | java.lang.String
|===

If a particular agent is matched by any of the rules, then the collector attempts to collect the referenced groups from the agent.

[[ga-performance-mgmt-collectors-wsman-group-definitions]]
=== Group definitions

Groups are retrieved by issuing an Enumerate command against a particular `Resource URI` and parsing the results.
The Enumerate commands can include an optional `filter` to filter the records and attributes that are returned.

When you configure a filter, you must also specify the dialect.

The resource type the group uses must of be of type `node` or a generic resource type.
Interface-level resources are not supported.

With a generic resource type, you cannot use the `IndexStorageStrategy` since records have no implicit index.
Instead, you must use an alternative such as the `SiblingColumnStorageStrategy`.

If a record includes a multi-valued key, you can collect the value at a specific index with an `index-of` expression.
This is best demonstrated with an example.
Assume we want to collect the `ServiceTag` from the following record:

[source, xml]
----
<IdentifyingDescriptions>CIM:GUID</IdentifyingDescriptions>
<IdentifyingDescriptions>CIM:Tag</IdentifyingDescriptions>
<IdentifyingDescriptions>DCIM:ServiceTag</IdentifyingDescriptions>
<OtherIdentifyingInfo>45454C4C-3700-104A-8052-C3C01BB25031</OtherIdentifyingInfo>
<OtherIdentifyingInfo>mainsystemchassis</OtherIdentifyingInfo>
<OtherIdentifyingInfo>C8BBBP1</OtherIdentifyingInfo>
----

Specifying the attribute name `OtherIdentifyingInfo` would not be sufficient, since there are multiple values for that key.
Instead, we want to retrieve the value for the `OtherIdentifyingInfo` key at the same index where `IdentifyingDescriptions` is set to `DCIM:ServiceTag`.

Use the following attribute definition to achieve this:

[source, xml]
----
<attrib name="OtherIdentifyingInfo" index-of="#IdentifyingDescriptions matches '.*ServiceTag'" alias="serviceTag" type="String"/>
----

[[ga-performance-mgmt-collectors-wsman-special-attributes]]
=== Special attributes

A group can contain the placeholder attribute `ElementCount` that, during collection, will be populated with the total number of results returned for that group.
Use this to threshold on the number results returned by an enumeration.

[source, xml]
----
<group name="Event-1234"
        resource-uri="http://schemas.microsoft.com/wbem/wsman/1/wmi/root/cimv2/*"
        dialect="http://schemas.microsoft.com/wbem/wsman/1/WQL"
        filter="select * from Win32_NTLogEvent where LogFile = 'Some-Application-Specific-Logfile/Operational' AND EventCode = '1234'"
        resource-type="node">
    <attrib name="##ElementCount##" alias="elementCount" type="Gauge"/>
</group>
----
