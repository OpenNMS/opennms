= Reset the Web UI Admin Password

This section explains how to set the web UI admin password using the {page-component-title} installation script.

After you install {page-component-title}, the web UI admin user's password is set to `admin` by default.
You can change this password after the initial login to the {page-component-title} web UI.
In the case of a forgotten password or deployment scenarios that require users to set this password on installation you can use the {page-component-title} installation script to reset this password.

You need to add the option ` -R` (or `--reset-webui-password`) and provide the password to set as an argument.
