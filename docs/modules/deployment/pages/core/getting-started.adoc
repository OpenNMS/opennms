= Installation and Configuration

This section explains how to install and configure a new {page-component-title} instance.

[[objectives-setup-core]]
== Objectives

* Install all required OpenNMS {page-component-title} components, including PostgreSQL, on a single node.
* Run {page-component-title} core and PostgreSQL with the default configuration.
+
NOTE: The default configuration is not optimized to run in production or monitor large networks.

ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Horizon"]
** By default, your time series database is JRobin, which persists RRD files on the local file system.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Meridian"]
** By default, your time series database is RRDtool, which persists RRD files on the local file system.
endif::[]
* Log in to the web UI and change the `admin` account's default password.

[[requirements-core]]
== Requirements

ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Meridian"]
* Credentials to access the Meridian repositories.
endif::[]
* A Linux physical server or a virtual machine running a supported <<core/system-requirements.adoc#operating-systems-core, Linux operating system>>.
* Internet access to download the installation packages.
* A working DNS server, and a localhost and server name that resolve properly.
* A system user with administrative permissions (`sudo`) to perform installation.
* If in use: A SELinux policy that permits binding to the ICMP service.
+
Note that failure to include the appropriate SELinux policy may generate an ICMP permission error when starting {page-component-title} (see xref:reference:configuration/selinux.adoc[]).
ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Horizon"]
* To run services in https://docs.docker.com/[Docker], you need https://docs.docker.com/compose/install[Docker Compose] for the service stacks from our examples.

NOTE: On Debian, you must install and configure `sudo` yourself.
See the https://wiki.debian.org/sudo/[Debian Wiki] for more information.

[[setup-postgresql]]
== Set up PostgreSQL

TIP: PostgreSQL 14 and 15 use the `scram-sha-256` https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/auth-password.html[password authentication] method by default.
If you use older versions of PostgreSQL, you should change the method in `postgresql.conf` and in `pg_hba.conf` before continuing with the <<install-core-instance, core instance installation>>.

[[install-core-instance]]
== Install the core instance

IMPORTANT: For security reasons, {page-component-title} is designed to run within an organization's protected intranet.
Do not expose the web console and login pages directly to the Internet without appropriate isolation controls (for example, a VPN with multi-factor authentication).

[[ga-data-choices]]
== First-time login and data choices

After you start the {page-component-title} core services, you can access the web application at `\http://core-instance-ip:8980/opennms`.
The default user login is `admin` with the password `admin`.

IMPORTANT: After you log in for the first time, immediately change the `admin` account's password to a secure one.

The first time you log in, {page-component-title} prompts for permission to allow the Data Choices module to collect and publish anonymous usage statistics to https://stats.opennms.org.
The OpenNMS Group uses this anonymized information to help determine product use and to improve the {page-component-title} software.
We do not share it with third parties, and we will not use it for sales purposes.

.Data sources collection permission prompt
image::deployment/core/data-sources.png["Data sources collection permission prompt displaying opt-in and opt-out buttons", 500]

Click *Show Me What is Being Sent* to see xref:operation:deep-dive/admin/configuration/data-collection.adoc[what information we collect].
Statistics collection and publication happen only if an admin user opts in.

NOTE: Admin users can xref:operation:deep-dive/admin/configuration/data-collection.adoc#disable-data-collection[enable or disable statistics collection] at any time.

. On the top menu bar, click menu:Admin[Change Password].
. Type your current password and new password in the appropriate fields.
. Confirm your new password, and click *Submit*.

We encourage you to use {page-component-title} with individual user accounts instead of the `admin` account.
If all users have individual accounts, you can see who is completing tasks like clearing or acknowledging alarms.

For information on how to create a personalized user account, see xref:operation:quick-start/users.adoc#create-user[Create a new user] in the Quick Start guide.

== First monitored node

The default configuration will discover a single node with an interface `127.0.0.1` and detect services exposed on the loopback interface, including the OpenNMS-JVM service.
Nodes with this service have JMX-based data collection performed on Java JVM statistics such as heap memory and open file handles.
