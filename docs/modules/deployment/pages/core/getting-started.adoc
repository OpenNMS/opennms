== Objectives

* Install all required OpenNMS {page-component-title} components including PostgreSQL on a single node
* Run {page-component-title} Core and PostgreSQL with the default configuration (which is not optimized to run in production and monitor large networks)
ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Horizon"]
** By default your time series storage is JRobin, which persists RRD files on the local file system
endif::[]
ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Meridian"]
** By default your time series storage is RRDtool, which persists RRD files on the local file system
endif::[]
* Log in to the web UI and change the default admin password

[[requirements-core]]
== Requirements

ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Meridian"]
* Credentials to access the Meridian repositories
endif::[]
* Linux physical server or a virtual machine running a supported xref:deployment:core/system-requirements.adoc#operating-systems-core[Linux operating system]
* Internet access to download the installation packages
* DNS works and localhost and your server's host name resolve properly
* System user with administrative permissions (sudo) to perform installation
ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Horizon"]
* To run services in link:https://docs.docker.com/[Docker] you need link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/install[Docker Compose] for the service stacks from our examples

NOTE: On Debian, you must install and configure `sudo` yourself.
      See the link:https://wiki.debian.org/sudo/[Debian Wiki] for more information.

IMPORTANT: For security reasons, {page-component-title} is designed to run within an organization's protected intranet.
Do not expose the web console and login pages directly to the Internet without appropriate isolation controls (for example, a VPN with multi-factor authentication).

== Encrypt database credentials

It is also possible to store the PostgreSQL credentials in the secure credentials vault.
To achieve this, use the `scvcli` command line utility to add the credentials, and reference these credentials in your `opennms-datasources.xml` file.

.Create encrypted credentials for the PostgreSQL database connections:
[source, console]
----
./bin/scvcli set postgres opennms opennms-password
./bin/scvcli set postgres-admin postgres postgres-password
----

.Reference the encrypted credentials stored in the secure credentials vault:
[source, xml]
----
<jdbc-data-source name="opennms"
                    database-name="opennms"
                    class-name="org.postgresql.Driver"
                    url="jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/opennms"
                    user-name="${scv:postgres:username}"
                    password="${scv:postgres:password}" />

<jdbc-data-source name="opennms-admin"
                    database-name="template1"
                    class-name="org.postgresql.Driver"
                    url="jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/template1"
                    user-name="${scv:postgres-admin:username}"
                    password="${scv:postgres-admin:password}" />

== Receive SNMP Traps/Informs

OpenNMS {page-component-title} core lets you receive and process SNMP Traps/Informs out of the box.
The OpenNMS {page-component-title} core services run as an unprivileged user and can't bind on port numbers < 1024 without escalated privileges.
For this reason, the default port for the SNMP Trap/Inform listener is set to port number 10162/udp instead of the IANA registered port number 162/udp.
The following example shows how to configure the local firewall daemon to forward port 162/udp to 10162/udp.

NOTE: If you need SNMP Trap listener on port 162/udp directly, see the "Binding to privileged ports" steps in <<core/getting-started.adoc#set-up-core-instance, Set up the Core Instance>>.

You can verify your firewall and port forwarding configuration by sending an SNMP trap from a remote system to your OpenNMS {page-component-title} core instance with the following command:

[source, console]
----
snmptrap -v 2c -c public opennms-core-host '' 1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.991.17 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6.0 s "Milky Way"<1><2>
----
<1> By default, OpenNMS uses the community string `public`.
If you changed the community string in OpenNMS, use that name here.
<2> Replace `opennms-core-host` with the IP or FQDN of your OpenNMS {page-component-title} core instance.

On RHEL/CentOS the `snmptrap` command line tool is part of the `net-snmp-utils`.
When you run on Debian/Ubuntu, you have to install the `snmp-utils` package.

Your configuration works as expected when you see an SNMP trap event in the web UI.

. Log in to the web UI.
. Click menu:Status[Events > All events].
. Verify you received a `uei.opennms.org/generic/traps/EnterpriseDefault` event from your test host.

== First login

After you start the {page-component-title} Core services, access the web application at +
`\http://core-instance-ip:8980/opennms`.
The default login and password is *admin*.

IMPORTANT: Immediately change the password to a secure one.

. Open `\http://core-instance-ip:8980/opennms` in your web browser.
. Log in with with admin/admin.
. Click  btn:[admin] -> btn:[Change Password] in the navigation bar.
. Use *admin* as the current password then type and confirm a new password in the appropriate boxes.
. Click btn:[Submit].
. Log out, then log in with your new password.

== First monitored node
The default configuration will discover a single node with an interface 127.0.0.1 and detect services exposed on the loopback interface, including the OpenNMS-JVM service.
Nodes with this service have JMX-based data collection performed on Java JVM statistics such as heap memory and open file handles.
