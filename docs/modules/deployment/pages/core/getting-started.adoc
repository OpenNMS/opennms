= Installation and Configuration

This section explains how to install and configure a new {page-component-title} instance.

[[objectives-setup-core]]
== Objectives

* Install all required OpenNMS {page-component-title} components, including PostgreSQL, on a single node.
* Run {page-component-title} core and PostgreSQL with the default configuration.
+
NOTE: The default configuration is not optimized to run in production or monitor large networks.

ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Horizon"]
** By default, your time series database is JRobin, which persists RRD files on the local file system.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Meridian"]
** By default, your time series database is RRDtool, which persists RRD files on the local file system.
endif::[]
* Log in to the web UI and change the default admin password.

[[requirements-core]]
== Requirements

ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Meridian"]
* Credentials to access the Meridian repositories.
endif::[]
* A Linux physical server or a virtual machine running a supported xref:deployment:core/system-requirements.adoc#operating-systems-core[Linux operating system].
* Internet access to download the installation packages.
* A working DNS server, and a localhost and server name that resolve properly.
* A system user with administrative permissions (`sudo`) to perform installation.
ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Horizon"]
* To run services in https://docs.docker.com/[Docker], you need https://docs.docker.com/compose/install[Docker Compose] for the service stacks from our examples.

NOTE: On Debian, you must install and configure `sudo` yourself.
See the https://wiki.debian.org/sudo/[Debian Wiki] for more information.

[[setup-postgresql]]
== Set up PostgreSQL

TIP: PostgreSQL 14 uses the `scram-sha-256` https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/auth-password.html[password authentication] method by default.
If you use older versions of PostgreSQL, you should change the method in `postgresql.conf` and in `pg_hba.conf` before continuing with the <<install-core-instance, core instance installation>>.

[[install-core-instance]]
== Install the core instance

IMPORTANT: For security reasons, {page-component-title} is designed to run within an organization's protected intranet.
Do not expose the web console and login pages directly to the Internet without appropriate isolation controls (for example, a VPN with multi-factor authentication).

== Encrypt database credentials

It is also possible to store the PostgreSQL credentials in the secure credentials vault.
To achieve this, use the `scvcli` command line utility to add the credentials, and reference these credentials in `opennms-datasources.xml`.

.Create encrypted credentials for the PostgreSQL database connections:
[source, console]
----
./bin/scvcli set postgres opennms opennms-password
./bin/scvcli set postgres-admin postgres postgres-password
----

.Reference the encrypted credentials stored in the secure credentials vault:
[source, xml]
----
<jdbc-data-source name="opennms"
                    database-name="opennms"
                    class-name="org.postgresql.Driver"
                    url="jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/opennms"
                    user-name="${scv:postgres:username}"
                    password="${scv:postgres:password}" />

<jdbc-data-source name="opennms-admin"
                    database-name="template1"
                    class-name="org.postgresql.Driver"
                    url="jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/template1"
                    user-name="${scv:postgres-admin:username}"
                    password="${scv:postgres-admin:password}" />

[[receive-snmp-traps]]
== Receive SNMP traps/informs

{page-component-title} core lets you receive and process SNMP traps/informs out of the box.
{page-component-title} services run as an unprivileged user and can't bind on port numbers below `1024` without escalated privileges.
For this reason, the default port for the SNMP trap/inform listener is set to port number `10162/udp` instead of the IANA registered port number `162/udp`.
The following example shows how to configure the local firewall daemon to forward port `162/udp` to `10162/udp`.

NOTE: If you need the SNMP trap listener on port `162/udp` directly, see the "Binding to privileged ports" steps in <<core/getting-started.adoc#set-up-core-instance, Set up the core instance>>.

====

You can verify your firewall and port forwarding configuration by sending an SNMP trap from a remote system to your {page-component-title} core instance:

[source, console]
----
snmptrap -v 2c -c public opennms-core-host '' 1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.991.17 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6.0 s "Milky Way"<1><2>
----

. By default, OpenNMS uses the `public` community string.
If you changed the community string in {page-component-title}, use that name here.
. Replace `opennms-core-host` with the IP or FQDN of your {page-component-title} core instance.

On RHEL and CentOS, the `snmptrap` command line tool is part of the `net-snmp-utils`.
If you run on Debian or Ubuntu, the tool is part of the `snmp-utils` package.

Your configuration works as expected when you see an SNMP trap event in the web UI.

. Log in to the web UI.
. Click menu:Status[Events > All Events].
. Verify that you received a `uei.opennms.org/generic/traps/EnterpriseDefault` event from your test host.

== First login

After you start the {page-component-title} core services, access the web application at `\http://core-instance-ip:8980/opennms`.
The default login and password is *admin*.

IMPORTANT: Immediately xref:operation:quick-start/users.adoc#ga-admin-user-setup[change the `admin` account password] to a secure one.

== First monitored node

The default configuration will discover a single node with an interface `127.0.0.1` and detect services exposed on the loopback interface, including the OpenNMS-JVM service.
Nodes with this service have JMX-based data collection performed on Java JVM statistics such as heap memory and open file handles.

== Next steps

See the xref:operation:quick-start/introduction.adoc[Quick Start guide] for more information on setting up and configuring your {page-component-title} instance.
