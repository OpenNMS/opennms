= Installation and Configuration

This section explains how to install and configure a new {page-component-title} instance.
It describes how to do the following tasks:

* Install all required OpenNMS {page-component-title} components, including PostgreSQL, on a single node.
* Run {page-component-title} core and PostgreSQL with the default configuration.
+
NOTE: The default configuration is not optimized to run in a production environment or monitor large networks.

ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Horizon"]
** By default, your time series database is JRobin, which persists RRD files on the local file system.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Meridian"]
** By default, your time series database is RRDtool, which persists RRD files on the local file system.
endif::[]
* Sign in to the web UI and change the `admin` account's default password.

== Requirements

The following components and settings are required to set up a new {page-component-title} instance:

ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Meridian"]
* Credentials to access the Meridian repositories.
endif::[]
* A Linux physical server, or a virtual machine running a <<core/system-requirements.adoc#operating-systems-core, supported Linux operating system>>.
* Internet access to download the installation packages.
* A working DNS server, and a localhost and server name that resolve properly.
* A system user with administrative permissions (`sudo`) to perform installation.
* A SELinux policy that permits binding to the ICMP service, if necessary.
+
NOTE: If you do not include the appropriate SELinux policy, {page-component-title} may generate an ICMP permissions error when starting up (see xref:reference:configuration/selinux.adoc[]).

ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Horizon"]
* To run services in Docker, you need https://docs.docker.com/compose/install[Docker Compose] for the service stacks from our examples.
* On Debian, you must install and configure `sudo` yourself.
See the https://wiki.debian.org/sudo/[Debian Wiki] for more information.

[[setup-postgresql]]
== Set up PostgreSQL

TIP: PostgreSQL 14 and 15 use the `scram-sha-256` https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/auth-password.html[password authentication] method by default.
If you use older versions of PostgreSQL, you should change the method in `postgresql.conf` and in `pg_hba.conf` before installing the {page-component-title} core instance.

[[install-core-instance]]
== Install the core instance

IMPORTANT: For security reasons, {page-component-title} is designed to run within an organization's protected intranet.
Do not expose the web console or sign in pages directly to the Internet without appropriate isolation controls (for example, a VPN with multi-factor authentication).

== First-time sign in

After you start the {page-component-title} core services, you can access the web application at `\http://core-instance-ip:8980/opennms`.
The default user credentials are as follows:

* *Username:* `admin`
* *Password:* `admin`

IMPORTANT: After you sign in for the first time, you should immediately change the `admin` account's password to a secure one.

To change your account's password, follow these steps:

. On the top menu bar, click menu:Admin[Change Password].
. Type your current password and new password in the appropriate fields.
. Confirm your new password, and click *Submit*.

The password is updated.

We encourage you to use {page-component-title} with individual user accounts instead of using only the `admin` account.
If all users have individual accounts, you can see who is completing tasks (for example, clearing or acknowledging alarms).
For information on how to create personalized user accounts, see xref:operation:quick-start/users.adoc#create-user[Create a new user] in the Quick Start guide.

[[usage-statistics]]
=== Usage statistics

The first time you sign in, {page-component-title} notifies you that it collects anonymized usage statistics and publishes them to https://stats.opennms.com.
Consent to share collected usage statistics is assumed by default.

The OpenNMS Group uses this information to help determine product use and to improve the {page-component-title} software.
We do not share it with third parties, and we will not use it for sales purposes.

Click *Learn More* to view the xref:operation:deep-dive/admin/configuration/usage-statistics.adoc[information that we collect and share].
This also hides the notification.

Click *Dismiss* to simply hide the notification.
You can view the usage statistics at any time on the admin page.

NOTE: Admin users can xref:operation:deep-dive/admin/configuration/usage-statistics.adoc#disable-data-collection[opt out of sharing the statistics] at any time.

== First monitored node

The default configuration will discover a single node with an interface `127.0.0.1` and detect services exposed on the loopback interface, including the `OpenNMS-JVM` service.
Nodes with this service have JMX-based data collection performed on Java JVM statistics such as heap memory and open file handles.
