== Objectives

* Install all required OpenNMS {page-component-title} components including PostgreSQL on a single node
* Run {page-component-title} Core and PostgreSQL with the default configuration (which is not optimized to run in production and monitor large networks)
ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Horizon"]
** By default your time series storage is JRobin, which persists RRD files on the local file system
endif::[]
ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Meridian"]
** By default your time series storage is RRDtool, which persists RRD files on the local file system
endif::[]
* Log in to the web UI and change the default admin password

== Requirements

ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Meridian"]
* Credentials to access the Meridian repositories
endif::[]
* Linux physical server or a virtual machine running a supported xref:deployment:core/system-requirements.adoc#operating-systems-core[Linux operating system]
* Internet access to download the installation packages
* DNS works and localhost and your server's host name resolve properly
* System user with administrative permissions (sudo) to perform installation
ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Horizon"]
* To run services in link:https://docs.docker.com/[Docker] you need link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/install[Docker Compose] for the service stacks from our examples

NOTE: On Debian, you must install and configure `sudo` yourself.
      See the link:https://wiki.debian.org/sudo/[Debian Wiki] for more information.

== Receive SNMP Traps/Informs

OpenNMS {page-component-title} core lets you receive and process SNMP Traps/Informs out of the box.
The OpenNMS {page-component-title} core services run as an unprivileged user and can't bind on port numbers < 1024 without escalated privileges.
For this reason, the default port for the SNMP Trap/Inform listener is set to port number 10162/udp instead of the IANA registered port number 162/udp.
The following example shows how to configure the local firewall daemon to forward port 162/udp to 10162/udp.

TIP: If you need SNMP Trap listener on port 162/udp directly, you can add the Linux `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` capability to the Java binary using `setcap`.
     Be aware: this method allows any Java program run on your system to bind to privileged ports < 1024.

You can verify your firewall and port forwarding configuration by sending an SNMP trap from a remote system to your OpenNMS {page-component-title} core instance with the following command:

[source, console]
----
snmptrap -v 2c -c public opennms-core-host '' 1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.991.17 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6.0 s "Milky Way"<1><2>
----
<1> By default, OpenNMS uses the community string `public`. 
If you changed the community string in OpenNMS, use that name here.
<2> Replace `opennms-core-host` with the IP or FQDN of your OpenNMS {page-component-title} core instance.

On RHEL/CentOS the `snmptrap` command line tool is part of the `net-snmp-utils`. 
When you run on Debian/Ubuntu, you have to install the `snmp-utils` package.

Your configuration works as expected when you see an SNMP trap event in the web UI.

. Log in to the web UI.
. Click menu:Status[Events > All events].
. Verify you received a `uei.opennms.org/generic/traps/EnterpriseDefault` event from your test host.

== First login

After you start the {page-component-title} Core services, access the web application at +
`\http://core-instance-ip:8980/opennms`.
The default login and password is *admin*.

IMPORTANT: Immediately change the password to a secure one.

. Open `\http://core-instance-ip:8980/opennms` in your web browser.
. Log in with with admin/admin.
. Click  btn:[admin] -> btn:[Change Password] in the navigation bar.
. Use *admin* as the current password then type and confirm a new password in the appropriate boxes.
. Click btn:[Submit].
. Log out, then log in with your new password.

== First monitored node
The default configuration will discover a single node with an interface 127.0.0.1 and detect services exposed on the loopback interface, including the OpenNMS-JVM service.
Nodes with this service have JMX-based data collection performed on Java JVM statistics such as heap memory and open file handles.
