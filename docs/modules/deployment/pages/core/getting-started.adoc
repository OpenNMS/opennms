= Installation and configuration

[[objectives-setup-core]]
== Objectives

* Install all required OpenNMS {page-component-title} components including PostgreSQL on a single node
* Run {page-component-title} Core and PostgreSQL with the default configuration (which is not optimized to run in production and monitor large networks)
ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Horizon"]
** By default your time series storage is JRobin, which persists RRD files on the local file system
endif::[]
ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Meridian"]
** By default your time series storage is RRDtool, which persists RRD files on the local file system
endif::[]
* Log in to the web UI and change the default admin password

[[requirements-core]]
== Requirements

* Linux physical server or a virtual machine running a supported xref:deployment:core/system-requirements.adoc#operating-systems-core[Linux operating system]
* Internet access to download the installation packages
* DNS works and localhost and your server's host name resolve properly
* System user with administrative permissions (sudo) to perform installation
ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Horizon"]
* To run services in link:https://docs.docker.com/[Docker] you need link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/install[Docker Compose] for the service stacks from our examples

NOTE: On Debian, you must install and configure `sudo` yourself.
      See the link:https://wiki.debian.org/sudo/[Debian Wiki] for more information.
