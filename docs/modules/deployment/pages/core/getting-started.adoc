= Installation and Configuration

This section explains how to install and configure a new {page-component-title} instance.

[[objectives-setup-core]]
== Objectives

* Install all required OpenNMS {page-component-title} components, including PostgreSQL, on a single node.
* Run {page-component-title} core and PostgreSQL with the default configuration.
+
NOTE: The default configuration is not optimized to run in production or monitor large networks.

ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Horizon"]
** By default, your time series database is JRobin, which persists RRD files on the local file system.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Meridian"]
** By default, your time series database is RRDtool, which persists RRD files on the local file system.
endif::[]
* Log in to the web UI and change the `admin` account's default password.

[[requirements-core]]
== Requirements

ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Meridian"]
* Credentials to access the Meridian repositories.
endif::[]
* A Linux physical server or a virtual machine running a supported <<core/system-requirements.adoc#operating-systems-core, Linux operating system>>.
* Internet access to download the installation packages.
* A working DNS server, and a localhost and server name that resolve properly.
* A system user with administrative permissions (`sudo`) to perform installation.
* A SELinux policy that permits binding to the ICMP service (if you are using an operating system that includes SELinux).
+
Note that failure to include the appropriate SELinux policy may generate an ICMP permission error when starting OpenNMS (see <<selinux-icmp, SELinux and ICMP permissions>>).
ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Horizon"]
* To run services in https://docs.docker.com/[Docker], you need https://docs.docker.com/compose/install[Docker Compose] for the service stacks from our examples.

NOTE: On Debian, you must install and configure `sudo` yourself.
See the https://wiki.debian.org/sudo/[Debian Wiki] for more information.

[[selinux-icmp]]
=== SELinux and ICMP permissions

If you have SELinux enabled on your {page-component-title} server, there must be a policy configured to allow {page-component-title} to bind to the ICMP service.

NOTE: The steps in this section apply specifically to CentOS 8.

To verify that you have SELinux running and enabled, use the `sestatus` console command.
If it is enabled, you should see the following:

[source, console]
----
SELinux status:                 enabled
SELinuxfs mount:                /sys/fs/selinux
SELinux root directory:         /etc/selinux
Loaded policy name:             targeted
Current mode:                   enforcing
Mode from config file:          enforcing
Policy MLS status:              enabled
Policy deny_unknown status:     allowed
Memory protection checking:     actual (secure)
Max kernel policy version:      33
----

Use `audit2allow -a` to check if {page-component-title} violates SELinux policies.

NOTE: If the `audit2allow` command is missing, run `dnf install policycoreutils-devel` to install the package.

Look for entries that prevent the binding of ICMP sockets:

[source, console]
----
#============= unconfined_service_t ==============
allow unconfined_service_t node_t:icmp_socket node_bind;

============= unconfined_service_t ==============
allow unconfined_service_t port_t:icmp_socket name_bind;
----

Create a type enforcement file (for example, `JniPing.te`):

[source, console]
----
module JniPing 1.0;

require {
        type unconfined_service_t;
        type node_t;
        type port_t;
        class icmp_socket { name_bind node_bind };
}

#============= unconfined_service_t ==============
allow unconfined_service_t node_t:icmp_socket node_bind;
allow unconfined_service_t port_t:icmp_socket name_bind;
----

Create a SElinux module and compile it:

[source, console]
----
checkmodule -M -m -o JniPing.mod JniPing.te
semodule_package -o JniPing.pp -m JniPing.mod
----

Install the SELinux package and enforce it:

[source, console]
----
semodule -i JniPing.pp
getenforce
----

You can verify the package with the following command: `semodule --list-modules | grep JniPing`.

Note that this command is based on the `audit2allow` command on a CentOS 8 system.

[[setup-postgresql]]
== Set up PostgreSQL

TIP: PostgreSQL 14 and 15 use the `scram-sha-256` https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/auth-password.html[password authentication] method by default.
If you use older versions of PostgreSQL, you should change the method in `postgresql.conf` and in `pg_hba.conf` before continuing with the <<install-core-instance, core instance installation>>.

[[install-core-instance]]
== Install the core instance

IMPORTANT: For security reasons, {page-component-title} is designed to run within an organization's protected intranet.
Do not expose the web console and login pages directly to the Internet without appropriate isolation controls (for example, a VPN with multi-factor authentication).

== Encrypt database credentials

It is possible to store the PostgreSQL credentials in the secure credentials vault.
To achieve this, use the `scvcli` command line utility to add the credentials, and reference these credentials in `opennms-datasources.xml`.

.Create encrypted credentials for PostgreSQL database connections:
[source, console]
----
sudo -u opennms ${OPENNMS_HOME}/bin/scvcli set postgres opennms password <1>
sudo -u opennms ${OPENNMS_HOME}/bin/scvcli set postgres-admin postgres password
----
<1> Replace both `password` instances with the actual passwords for your `opennms` and `postgres` database accounts.

.Reference encrypted credentials stored in the secure credentials vault:
[source, xml]
----
<jdbc-data-source name="opennms"
                    database-name="opennms"
                    class-name="org.postgresql.Driver"
                    url="jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/opennms"
                    user-name="${scv:postgres:username}"
                    password="${scv:postgres:password}" />

<jdbc-data-source name="opennms-admin"
                    database-name="template1"
                    class-name="org.postgresql.Driver"
                    url="jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/template1"
                    user-name="${scv:postgres-admin:username}"
                    password="${scv:postgres-admin:password}" />
----

[[ga-data-choices]]
== First-time login and data choices

After you start the {page-component-title} core services, you can access the web application at `\http://core-instance-ip:8980/opennms`.
The default user login is `admin` with the password `admin`.

IMPORTANT: After you log in for the first time, immediately change the `admin` account's password to a secure one.

The first time you log in, {page-component-title} prompts for permission to allow the Data Choices module to collect and publish anonymous usage statistics to https://stats.opennms.org.
The OpenNMS Group uses this anonymized information to help determine product use and to improve the {page-component-title} software.
We do not share it with third parties, and we will not use it for sales purposes.

.Data sources collection permission prompt
image::deployment/core/data-sources.png["Data sources collection permission prompt displaying opt-in and opt-out buttons", 500]

Click *Show Me What is Being Sent* to see xref:operation:deep-dive/admin/configuration/data-collection.adoc[what information we collect].
Statistics collection and publication happen only if an admin user opts in.

NOTE: Admin users can xref:operation:deep-dive/admin/configuration/data-collection.adoc#disable-data-collection[enable or disable statistics collection] at any time.

. On the top menu bar, click menu:Admin[Change Password].
. Type your current password and new password in the appropriate fields.
. Confirm your new password, and click *Submit*.

We encourage you to use {page-component-title} with individual user accounts instead of the `admin` account.
If all users have individual accounts, you can see who is completing tasks like clearing or acknowledging alarms.

For information on how to create a personalized user account, see xref:operation:quick-start/users.adoc#create-user[Create a new user] in the Quick Start guide.

[[receive-snmp-traps]]
== Receive SNMP traps/informs

{page-component-title} core lets you receive and process SNMP traps and informs out of the box.
{page-component-title} services run as an unprivileged user and can't bind on port numbers below `1024` without escalated privileges.
For this reason, the default port for the SNMP trap/inform listener is set to port number `10162/udp` instead of the IANA registered port number `162/udp`.
The following example shows how to configure the local firewall daemon to forward port `162/udp` to `10162/udp`.

NOTE: If you need the SNMP trap listener on port `162/udp` directly, see the "Binding to privileged ports" steps in <<core/getting-started.adoc#set-up-core-instance, Set up the core instance>>.

====

You can verify your firewall and port forwarding configuration by sending an SNMP trap from a remote system to your {page-component-title} core instance:

[source, console]
snmptrap -v 2c -c public opennms-core-host '' 1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.991.17 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6.0 s "Milky Way" <1><2>

<1> By default, {page-component-title} uses the `public` community string.
If you changed the community string in {page-component-title}, use that name here.
<2> Replace `opennms-core-host` with the IP or FQDN of your {page-component-title} core instance.

On RHEL and CentOS, the `snmptrap` command line tool is part of the `net-snmp-utils`.
If you run on Debian or Ubuntu, the tool is part of the `snmp-utils` package.

Your configuration works as expected when you see an SNMP trap event in the web UI.

. Log in to the web UI.
. Click menu:Status[Events > All Events].
. Verify that you received a `uei.opennms.org/generic/traps/EnterpriseDefault` event from your test host.

== First monitored node

The default configuration will discover a single node with an interface `127.0.0.1` and detect services exposed on the loopback interface, including the OpenNMS-JVM service.
Nodes with this service have JMX-based data collection performed on Java JVM statistics such as heap memory and open file handles.

== Next steps

See the xref:operation:quick-start/introduction.adoc[Quick Start guide] for more information on setting up and configuring your {page-component-title} instance.
