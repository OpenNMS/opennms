[[objectives-setup-core]]
== Objectives

* Install all required OpenNMS {page-component-title} components including PostgreSQL on a single node
* {page-component-title} Run Core and PostgreSQL with the default configuration, which is not optimized to run in production and monitor large networks
ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Horizon"]
* By default your time series storage is JRobin, which persists RRD files on the local file system
endif::[]
ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Meridian"]
* By default your time series storage is RRDtool, which persists RRD files on the local file system and is the default
endif::[]
* Log in to the web UI and change the default admin password

[[requirements-core]]
== Requirements

* Linux physical server or a virtual machine running a supported xref:deployment:core/system-requirements.adoc#operating-systems-core[Linux operating system]
* Internet access to download the installation packages
* DNS works and localhost and your server's host name resolve properly
* System user with administrative permissions (sudo) to perform installation
ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Horizon"]
* To run services in link:https://docs.docker.com/[Docker] you need link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/install[Docker Compose] for the service stacks from our examples
