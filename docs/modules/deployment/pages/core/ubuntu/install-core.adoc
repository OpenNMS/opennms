TIP: Disable the OpenNMS {page-component-title} repository after installation to prevent unwanted upgrades when upgrading other packages on the server.
     After upgrade, {page-component-title} requires manual steps to upgrade configuration files or migrate database schemas to a new version.
     We recommend that you exclude the {page-component-title} packages from update except when you are planning on performing an upgrade.
