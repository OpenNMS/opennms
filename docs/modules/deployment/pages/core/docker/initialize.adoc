TIP: When you run upgrades you can use this command as well.
     You have to delete the file `etc/configured` file first.
     It works as a guard to prevent unnecessary database migration runs on startup.

TIP: You can show configuration changes from a pristine system with  +
     `docker-compose exec -w /opt/opennms/bin horizon ./config-diff.sh -d`.

TIP: If you have changed your configuration files manually you can run the configuration tester with +
     `docker-compose exec horizon bin/config-tester -a`

.Start the service in background
[source, console]

docker-compose up -d
