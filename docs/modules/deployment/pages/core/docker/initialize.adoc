TIP: You can also use this command when you run upgrades.
     You must delete the file `etc/configured` file first.
     It works as a guard to prevent unnecessary database migration runs on startup.

     Show configuration changes from a pristine system with  +
     `docker-compose exec -w /opt/opennms/bin horizon ./config-diff.sh -d`.
     +
     +
     If you changed your configuration files manually you can run the configuration tester with +
     `docker-compose exec horizon bin/config-tester -a`
