=== Debugging

When debugging, it may be helpful to lower the minimum severity at which a component will log from the default level of `WARN`.
To change this setting, edit `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/log4j2.xml` and locate the following lines:

[source,xml]
----
<KeyValuePair key="..." value="WARN" />
----

You can alter the log level to one of the following values: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`.
Changes to `log4j2.xml` take effect within 60 seconds with no extra action needed.

On busy systems, setting the log level to `DEBUG` may create so much noise as to be impractical or even have performance impacts.
