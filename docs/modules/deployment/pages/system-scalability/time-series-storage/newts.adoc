link:http://newts.io/[Newts] is a time-series data schema for link:http://cassandra.apache.org/[Apache Cassandra].
It enables link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability#Horizontal[horizontal scaling] capabilities for your time series storage and is an alternative to link:https://github.com/OpenNMS/jrobin[JRobin] and link:http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/[RRDtool].

The _Cassandra_ cluster design, setup, sizing, tuning and operation is out of scope for this section.
To install and set up a _Cassandra_ cluster please follow the link:http://cassandra.apache.org/download[Cassandra installation instructions].
For further information see link:https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/getting_started/index.html[Cassandra Getting Started Guide].

TIP: To avoid unwanted updates and disable the Cassandra repository on DNF/YUM based distributions or use `apt-mark hold cassandra` on APT based distributions.

IMPORTANT: For simplicity we use the `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/bin/newts init` command which initializes a Newts keyspace for you and the defaults are not optimal tuned for a production-ready environment.
           If you want to build a production environment please consult link:https://opennms.discourse.group/t/sizing-cassandra-for-newts/771[Sizing Cassandra for Newts] and link:https://docs.datastax.com/en/dse-planning/doc/planning/planningAntiPatterns.html[planning Anti-patterns in Cassandra] articles.

== Objectives

* Configure {page-component-title} to use an existing _Cassandra_ cluster
* Initializing the Newts keyspace using `newts init` with STCS without production-ready tuning
* Verify time series data is stored and can be accessed

== Before you begin

* A running instance of {page-component-title} running on Linux
* Working data collection and response time metrics from _Collectd_ and _Pollerd_
* Cassandra cluster with access to the Cassandra client port `9042/tcp`

NOTE: Configurations has to be made in the `etc` directory relative to the {page-component-title} Core home directory.
      Depending on your operating system the home directory is `/usr/share/opennms` for Debian/Ubuntu or `/opt/opennms` for CentOS/RHEL.

== Configure {page-component-title} Core using Newts

.Create a configuration file with the time series storage settings
[source, console]
----
sudo vi etc/opennms.properties.d/timeseries.properties
----

.Configure the Newts as the time series strategy
[source, timeseries.properties]
----
# Configure storage strategy
org.opennms.rrd.storeByForeignSource=true<1>
org.opennms.timeseries.strategy=newts<2>

# Configure Newts time series storage connection
org.opennms.newts.config.hostname={cassandra-ip1,cassandra-ip2}<3>
org.opennms.newts.config.keyspace=newts<4>
org.opennms.newts.config.port=9042<5>

# One year in seconds
org.opennms.newts.config.ttl=31540000<6>

# Seven days in seconds
org.opennms.newts.config.resource_shard=604800<7>
----

<1> Associate time series data by the foreign ID instead of the database generated Node-ID. 
<2> Set time-series strategy to use `newts`.
<3> Host or IP addresses of the Cassandra cluster nodes. Can be a comma-separated list.
<4> Name of the keyspace which is initialized and used.
<5> Port to connect to Cassandra.
<6> Retention rate for the time series data.
<7> Shard metrics every 7 days.

.Initialize the Newts schema in Cassandra
[source, console]
----
bin/newts init
----

.Connect to Cassandra with the CQL shell
[source, console]
----
cd ${CASSANDRA_HOME}/bin
./cqlsh
----

.Verify if the keyspace was properly initialized
[source, console]
----
use newts;
describe table terms;
describe table samples;
----

.Apply changes and verify your configuration
[source, console]
----
systemctl restart opennms
----

With this infomration set, {page-component-title} will begin persisting metrics using the Newts engine when restarted.

Go to the Node detail page from a SNMP-managed device and verify that you see response time graphs for ICMP and node-level performance data.
