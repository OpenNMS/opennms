== Objectives

* Install a {page-component-title} Minion on one of the supported <<minion/system-requirements.adoc#operating-systems-Core, operating systems>>.
* Secure access to the Karaf shell with encrypted passwords.
* Configure connection to message broker for communication with the {page-component-title} core instance.
* Verify the setup.

== Requirements

* A {page-component-title} core instance running and configured with a <<core/setup-message-broker.adoc#setup-message-broker,message broker>>.
* A Linux physical server or a virtual machine running a supported Linux operating system.
* Internet access to download the installation packages.
* Java installed {compatible-javajdk}.
* DNS configured so that `localhost` and your server's host name resolve properly.
* A {page-component-title} core instance runs on latest stable release.
* A Minion server can access desired message broker nodes (for example, ActiveMQ `61616/tcp`, Apache Kafka `9092/tcp`).
* A system user with administrative permissions (sudo) to perform the installation tasks.

* If you are running the services in link:https://docs.docker.com/[Docker], you also need link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/install[Docker Compose] for the service stacks from our examples.

NOTE: If you run Debian, you must install and configure `sudo` yourself (see the link:https://wiki.debian.org/sudo/[Debian Wiki]).

== Secure access to Karaf shell

IMPORTANT: Change the default username and password (_admin/admin_) for the Karaf shell and encrypt it.

Changes to the password and encryption algorithm are applied immediately.
You do not need to restart the Minion.

TIP: By default, the Karaf Shell is restricted to `127.0.0.1`.
To enable remote access, set `sshHost=0.0.0.0` in `org.apache.karaf.shell.cfg`.
The change is applied immediately and you do not need to restart the Minion.
If you have a firewall running on your host, allow `8201/tcp` to grant access to the Karaf shell.

== Configure connectivity to the core instance

Set configuration settings in the {page-component-title} `etc` directory.
We reference `etc` relative to the OpenNMS {page-component-title} core home directory.
Depending on your operating system, the home directory is `/usr/share/opennms` for Debian and Ubuntu or `/opt/opennms` for CentOS and RHEL.
