== Objectives

* Install a {page-component-title} Minion on one of the supported <<minion/system-requirements.adoc#operating-systems-Core, operating systems>>
* Secure access to the Karaf shell with encrypted passwords 
* Configure connection to message broker for communication with the {page-component-title} core instance
* Verify the setup

== Requirements

* {page-component-title} core instance running and configured with a <<core/setup-message-broker.adoc#setup-message-broker,message broker>>
* Linux physical server or a virtual machine running a supported Linux operating system
* Internet access to download the installation packages
* Java installed {compatible-javajdk}
* DNS configured so that localhost and your server's host name resolve properly
* {page-component-title} core instance runs on latest stable release
* Minion server can access desired message broker nodes (for example, ActiveMQ 61616/tcp, Apache Kafka 9092/tcp).
* System user with administrative permissions (sudo) to perform the installation tasks
ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Horizon"]
* If you are running the services in link:https://docs.docker.com/[Docker] you also need link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/install[Docker Compose] for the service stacks from our examples

NOTE: If you run Debian, you have to install and configure `sudo` yourself (see the link:https://wiki.debian.org/sudo/[Debian Wiki]).

== Secure access to Karaf shell

IMPORTANT: Change the default user/password _admin/admin_ for the Karaf shell and encrypt it.

Changes to the password or encryption algorithm are applied immediately.
You do not need to restart the Minion.

TIP: By default, the Karaf Shell is restricted to 127.0.0.1.
     To enable remote access, set `sshHost=0.0.0.0` in `org.apache.karaf.shell.cfg`.
     The change is applied immediately and a Minion restart is not required.
     If you have a firewall running on your host, allow `8201/tcp` to grant access to the Karaf shell.

== Configure connectivity to the Core instance

Set configuration in the {page-component-title} `etc` directory.
We reference `etc` relative to the OpenNMS {page-component-title} Core home directory.
Depending on your operating system, the home directory is `/usr/share/opennms` for Debian/Ubuntu or `/opt/opennms` for CentOS/RHEL.

== Check Minion in the Core web UI

. Click the gears icon and choose *Manage Minions* in the *Distributed Monitoring* area. 

After a few minutes your Minion should be provisioned automatically and the status should be "up".
