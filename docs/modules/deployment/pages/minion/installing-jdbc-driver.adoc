= Installing JDBC Driver

For any JDBC service to be detected/polled/collected, corresponding JDBC driver needs to be installed in Minion.
Following are steps to install JDBC driver.

NOTE: We reference the `repository directory` relative to the Minion home directory.
      Depending on your operating system the home directory is `/usr/share/minion` for Debian/Ubuntu or `/opt/minion` for CentOS/RHEL.

1. Download the JDBC driver JAR from a repository, e.g. a public link:https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/mysql/mysql-connector-java/8.0.22[Maven Repository]
2. Install the JAR file in the repository directory following the maven repository pattern.
   For MySQL 8.0.22 the path would be `repositories/default/mysql/mysql-connector-java/8.0.22/mysql-connector-java-8.0.22.jar`.

3. Create a Karaf feature for the MySQL JDBC driver

.Create a features configuration file
[source, console]
----
sudo vi deploy/jdbc-mysql.xml
----

.Add the following content to download the MySQL JDBC driver
[source, jdbc-mysql.xml]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
-----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<features name="opennms-{page-component-version}"<1>
          xmlns="http://karaf.apache.org/xmlns/features/v1.4.0"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://karaf.apache.org/xmlns/features/v1.4.0 http://karaf.apache.org/xmlns/features/v1.4.0">
  <feature name="mysql-bundle" version="8.0.22" install="auto"><2>
    <bundle>wrap:mvn:mysql/mysql-connector-java/8.0.22</bundle><3>
  </feature>
</features>
-----

<1> The version should match with your {page-component-title} Core version
<2> The bundle is named `mysql-bundle` and we set the version number to `8.0.22`
<3> Bundle to download version `8.0.22` with Maven from official repositories

TIP: As soon you write the file, Karaf picks up the feature and tries to install it.
     You can troubleshoot the feature installation in the `data/log/karaf.log`

.Connect to the Karaf Shell
[source,console]
----
ssh -p 8201 admin@localhost
----

.Verify installation and startup of the feature
[source, karaf]
----
feature:list | grep mysql
----

.MySQL bundle is installed and available
[source, output]
----
mysql-bundle   | 8.0.22   | x        | Started     | opennms-28.0.0-SNAPSHOT  |
----
