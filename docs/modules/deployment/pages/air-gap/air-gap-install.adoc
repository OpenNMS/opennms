:description: Offline Installation directions for air-gapped environments

Some scenarios for deploying OpenNMS {page-component-title} require that the installation run in an isolated or "air-gapped" network. This page provides a directions for an offline installation of {page-component-title} into such a network. As with any offline installation of software, the exact steps may vary depending upon the precise environment details. Before attempting, users should be familiar with the basic OpenNMS {page-component-title} installation steps from our xref:core/getting-started.adoc[Getting Started page].

[[basic-process-outline]]
== Basic Process Outline

The basic process involves downloading the RPMs for OpenNMS {page-component-title} and any dependencies, transferring them to the air-gapped host, performing the installation, and then starting the install.

## Prerequisites
- A system with internet access to download packages
- Target system running a compatible distribution
- Sufficient disk space for package downloads
- Administrative privileges on both systems


## Part 1: Package Download (Internet-Connected System)

### Step 1: Create a Temporary Package Directory

Create a base directory to organize all downloaded packages.  This directory will become the base directory and dependencies will be included inside sub-folders to aid in knowing what order to install them.

```bash
mkdir ./airgap_rpm_files
```

### Step 2: Install OpenNMS Repository

Add the {page-component-title} repository and import the GPG key:

ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Horizon"]
```bash
dnf -y install https://yum.opennms.org/repofiles/opennms-repo-stable-rhel9.noarch.rpm
rpm --import https://yum.opennms.org/OPENNMS-GPG-KEY
```
endif::[]

ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Meridian"]
```bash
cat << EOF | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/opennms-meridian.repo
[meridian]
name=Meridian for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS
baseurl=https://REPO_USER:REPO_PASS@meridian.opennms.com/packages/2024/stable/rhel$releasever
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=http://yum.opennms.org/OPENNMS-GPG-KEY
EOF

sudo rpm --import https://yum.opennms.org/OPENNMS-GPG-KEY
```
endif::[]


### Step 3: Download OpenJDK

Download and install OpenJDK packages (OpenJDK 17 here but please refer to system requirements):

```bash
dnf install --downloadonly --downloaddir=/tmp/opennms_rpms java-17-openjdk-devel
mv ./tmp/opennms_rpms ./airgap_rpm_files/01-openjdk
dnf install -y java-17-openjdk-devel
```

### Step 4: Download PostgreSQL

Download PostgreSQL server packages (please refer to system requirements for version support):

```bash
dnf install --downloadonly --downloaddir=/tmp/opennms_rpms postgresql-server
mv ./tmp/opennms_rpms ./airgap_rpm_files/02-postgresql
dnf install -y postgresql-server
```

### Step 5: Download OpenNMS Core Packages

Download the basic OpenNMS packages. If you need other packages, this would be the step to add them in.

ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Horizon"]
```bash
dnf install --downloadonly --downloaddir=/tmp/opennms_rpms opennms-core opennms-webapp-jetty
mv ./tmp/opennms_rpms ./airgap_rpm_files/04-opennms
dnf install -y opennms-core opennms-webapp-jetty
```
endif::[]

ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Meridian"]
```bash
dnf install --downloadonly --downloaddir=/tmp/opennms_rpms meridian-core meridian-webapp-jetty
mv ./tmp/opennms_rpms ./airgap_rpm_files/04-opennms
dnf install -y meridian-core meridian-webapp-jetty
```
endif::[]

### Step 6 (Optional): Plugin Support

If you need additional OpenNMS plugins (e.g., for CIFS monitoring, Asset Inventory, etc), download these packages from the OpenNMS repositories and include them in your installation files.

## Part 2: Installation on Air-Gapped System

Transfer the files to your air-gapped system via USB, DVD, or link:https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2549.html[secure file transfer].

### Step 1: Locate The Files

Locate the directory where the install files are located after you have transfered them.
```bash
cd /mnt/opennms_transfer/airgap_rpm_files
```

### Step 2: Install OpenJDK

```bash
cd /mnt/01-openjdk
rpm -ivh <directory>/*.rpm
```

### Step 3: Install PostgreSQL

```bash
cd /mnt/02-postgresql
rpm -ivh <directory>/*.rpm
```

### Step 4: Install OpenNMS Core

```bash
cd /mnt/04-opennms
rpm -ivh <directory>/*.rpm
```

## Post-Installation

After completing the package installation, proceed with OpenNMS configuration as described in our xref:core/getting-started.adoc[Set up the core instance] documentation.

## Additional Considerations

### Version Compatibility

Ensure all package versions are compatible with your target system. Pay special attention to:
 - PostgreSQL version
 - OpenJDK version
 - RHEL/CentOS version compatibility

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **GPG Key Errors**: Ensure the OpenNMS GPG key is properly imported before package installation
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Verify all prerequisite packages are installed in the correct order
- **Permission Issues**: Ensure you have administrative privileges for all installation steps
- **FIPS Compliance Issues**: Reach out to OpenNMS Support for FIPS Compliance issues.
