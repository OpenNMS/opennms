= OpenNMS Time Series DB

The OpenNMS Time Series DB is a cloud-hosted service that provides a scalable time series database to store and persist performance metrics that {page-component-title} collects from monitored devices.

== Requirements

You must have the following to use the Time Series DB:

* Meridian 2023+.
* A Time Series DB subscription.
The subscription provides access to the https://portal.opennms.com[OpenNMS Portal], where you can retrieve your activation key and view Time Series DB metrics.
Contact sales@opennms.com to sign up.

NOTE: When you sign up for the Time Series DB subscription, you receive an activation email from The OpenNMS Group with a login for the OpenNMS Portal.
If you do not receive the activation email, contact your account manager.

== Deployment

Follow these steps to set up the Time Series DB in your environment:

. Update your OpenNMS Cloud Services Connector files.
. Configure Cloud Services settings.
. Obtain an activation key for the Cloud Services Connector.
. Enable Cloud Services connectivity.
. Allow {page-component-title} to make outgoing connections to the following gateways:
** TCP `auth.access.onms-dp-prod.production.prod.dataservice.opennms.com:443`
** TCP `gateway.onms-dp-prod.production.prod.dataservice.opennms.com:443`

NOTE: You should ensure that your firewall allows access to the gateways above.
If they are blocked, you cannot enable the Cloud Services.

=== Update Cloud Services Connector files

The OpenNMS Cloud Services Connector is an extension that lets your {page-component-title} instance send time series data to the OpenNMS-hosted cloud service.
The packages for this extension are installed by default, but they do need to be configured and activated.
You can use `yum` or `apt` to make sure your `opennms-cloud-plugin` package is up to date.

To ensure that the feature is activated on future service restarts, add the feature to a file in `featuresBoot.d`:

[source, console]
echo "opennms-plugin-cloud-core wait-for-kar=opennms-plugin-cloud" | sudo tee ${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/featuresBoot.d/plugin-cloud.boot

=== Configure Cloud Services

You must configure your {page-component-title} instance to load the Cloud Services plugin on start, and to direct storage to the cloud service.
To do so, copy the example `timeseries.properties` file to your working directory:

[source, shell]
cp ${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/examples/opennms.properties.d/hosted_tsdb.timeseries.properties ${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/opennms.properties.d/timeseries.properties

You can configure custom tags in the following contexts in `timeseries.properties`:

* Asset
* Interface
* Node
* Service
* Resource
* Metadata

NOTE: Only users who can access the data in their Time Series DB (for example, via Cortex or InfluxDB) can configure custom tags.

Below are examples of tag definitions:

[source, properties]
----
org.opennms.timeseries.tin.metatags.tag.node=${node:label}
org.opennms.timeseries.tin.metatags.tag.location=${node:location}
org.opennms.timeseries.tin.metatags.tag.geohash=${node:geohash}
org.opennms.timeseries.tin.metatags.tag.ifDescr=${ipInterface:if-description}
org.opennms.timeseries.tin.metatags.tag.label=${resource:label}
----

After the plugin is installed and configured, restart the {page-component-title} service:

[source, console]
systemctl restart opennms

=== Obtain an activation key and enable Cloud Services connectivity

An activation key lets your {page-component-title} instance connect to the Time Series DB cloud service.
You must log in to the OpenNMS Portal to access the key, copy it, and paste it into the appropriate page in {page-component-title}.

IMPORTANT: The activation key is valid for one hour.
If you do not use it within that time, you must log in to the OpenNMS Portal again, delete the instance, create a new instance, and generate a new key.

To obtain the activation key, follow these steps:

. If you have not already done so, activate your OpenNMS Portal account by clicking *Account Activation* in your welcome email.
. Sign in to the OpenNMS Portal.
. Choose *OpenNMS Meridian* in the left menu and click *Add Instance*.
. Specify the Time Series DB instance type and click *Continue*.
. Specify an instance name and click *Continue*.
. Copy the activation key and follow the instructions on the screen to activate your instance:
.. Sign in to Meridian.
.. In the top menu bar, click *Plugins > Cloud Services*.
.. Paste the activation key in the *Enter Activation Key* box, and click *Activate*.
. In OpenNMS Cloud, click *Finish*.

You should see time series summary information in the OpenNMS Portal UI within 15 minutes.
For more information on how to view this information, see <<view-time-series-data, View time series summary data>>.
To change the data collection frequency, see <<operation:deep-dive/performance-data-collection/collectd/collection-packages.adoc#ga-collectd-packages-services,Service configuration attributes>>.

== Troubleshooting

To verify that your Time Series DB is set up correctly, run the `health-check` command in Karaf.
The resulting output should be similar to the following example:

[source, karaf]
----
admin@opennms()> health-check
Verifying the health of the container

Verifying installed bundles                    [ Success  ]
Cloud status                                   [ Success  ] => Cloud status=SERVING
Connecting to ElasticSearch ReST API (Flows)   [ Success  ] => Not configured

=> Everything is awesome
----

Check the Karaf logs if the registration fails or the health check does not say `SERVING`.
If this is the case, you will need to open a support ticket.

You can also check if the `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/share/rrd` files are still being updated.
If they are not, this indicates that the Time Series DB is working.

[[view-time-series-data]]
== View time series summary data

You can view time series summary data, including health status, capacity, and metrics per second, in the OpenNMS Portal.
By default, the screen displays data for all OpenNMS instances that you have configured to use the Time Series DB.
You can filter to see data for a specific instance.

. Sign in to the https://portal.opennms.com[OpenNMS Portal].
. In the left menu, click *Time Series*.
. To see summary data for a specific instance, type an instance name in the *Search Instances* field.
+
The screen updates to display only that instance and its associated summary data.
