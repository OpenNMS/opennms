= Time Series Integration Layer

This section describes how to configure {page-component-title} to use the Time Series Integration Layer.

Traditionally, {page-component-title} supports storing time series data in RRD files on disk or via Newts in Cassandra.
These implementations require a deep knowledge of OpenNMS.
It is difficult to add another time series database.

The Time Series Integration Layer provides an easy way to support other time series databases with minimal effort.
It lets users integrate a new time series database via OSGi plugin.

IMPORTANT: These are experimental and not ready for use in a production environment.

Examples of time series plugins:
