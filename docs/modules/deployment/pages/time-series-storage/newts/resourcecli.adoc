= Resource Management Tool (resourcecli)

The resourcecli tool simplifies the process of listing or manually deleting collected data (resources) of a {page-component-title} instance.

With RRDTool- or JRobin-based storage, this process is easy: traverse the `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/share/rrd` directory and its subdirectories.
The `.rrd` or `.jrb` files can be listed or deleted for individual nodes.

Newts-based storage stores and indexes the data remotely on a Cassandra cluster.
In this case, you must query the cluster for available resources.
To delete resources you must gather and remove the data and all generated indexes.

The resourcecli tool works with Newts-based storage as well as with RRDTool and JRobin files.

== Use
The utility is installed by default and its wrapper script is located in the `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/bin` directory.

[source, console]
----
$ cd /path/to/opennms/bin

TIP: When invoked without parameters, the usage and help information is printed.

The resourcecli tool uses subcommands for the different tasks.
