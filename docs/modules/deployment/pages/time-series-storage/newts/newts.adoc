= Configure {page-component-title} to Use Newts

This section describes how to configure your {page-component-title} instance to use Newts.

== Setup

Follow these steps to set up Newts on your {page-component-title} instance:

. Create a configuration file with your time series database settings:
+
[source, console]
sudo vi etc/opennms.properties.d/timeseries.properties

. Configure the storage strategy:
+
[source, properties]
----
org.opennms.rrd.storeByForeignSource=true <1>
org.opennms.timeseries.strategy=newts <2>
----
<1> Associate time series data using the foreign source and ID instead of the database-generated node ID.
<2> Set time series strategy to use Newts.
If you are enabling the xref:time-series-storage/timeseries/time-series-storage.adoc#ga-dual-write-newts[dual write plugin] on an existing {page-component-title} installation and you want to keep historical metrics, make sure that the written data has expired before you set `org.opennms.timeseries.strategy` to `newts`.

. Configure the Newts time series storage connection:
+
[source, properties]
----
org.opennms.newts.config.hostname=cassandra-ip1,cassandra-ip2 <1>
org.opennms.newts.config.keyspace=newts <2>
org.opennms.newts.config.port=9042 <3>
----
<1> Host or IP addresses of the Cassandra cluster nodes.
Can be a comma-separated list.
<2> Name of the keyspace which is initialized and used.
<3> Port to connect to Cassandra.

. Set the retention rate and shard rate:
+
[source, properties]
----
# One year in seconds
org.opennms.newts.config.ttl=31540000 <1>

# Seven days in seconds
org.opennms.newts.config.resource_shard=604800 <2>
----
<1> Retention rate for the time series data.
<2> Shard metrics every 7 days.

. (Optional) If your {page-component-title} data collection or polling intervals have been modified, set the query minimum and heartbeat rates:
+
[source, properties]
----
org.opennms.newts.query.minimum_step=30000 <1>
org.opennms.newts.query.heartbeat=45000 <2>
----
<1> The shortest collection interval configured for any collectable or pollable service, in milliseconds (in this case, 30 seconds).
<2> The communication interval for the Newts service, in milliseconds.
Should be set to 1.5 times the `minimum_step` value.

. Initialize the Newts schema in Cassandra:
+
[source, console]
bin/newts init

. Connect to Cassandra using the CQL shell:
+
[source, console]
----
cd ${CASSANDRA_HOME}/bin
./cqlsh
----

== Verify setup

After you have set the time series database to Newts and configured its settings, you must verify your setup and restart {page-component-title}:

. Verify keyspace initialization:
+
[source, console]
----
use newts;
describe table terms;
describe table samples;
----

. Restart {page-component-title} to apply your changes and verify your configuration:
+
[source, console]
systemctl restart opennms

After it restarts, {page-component-title} will begin to persist metrics using the Newts engine.
You can go to the Node Detail page for any SNMP-managed device to verify your setup; you should see response time graphs for the node's ICMP and node-level performance data.

NOTE: Only metrics stored in Newts are displayed in graphs.
If you have data stored in RRD or JRB files, it will not be displayed unless it is xref:time-series-storage/newts/newts-repository-converter.adoc[migrated to Newts].
