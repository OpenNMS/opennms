= Sentinel

Sentinel provides scalability for data processing of flows and streaming telemetry.
It also supports thresholding for streaming telemetry if you are using OpenNMS xref:deployment:time-series-storage/newts/introduction.adoc#ga-opennms-operation-newts[Newts].
The Sentinel can distribute Telemetryd functionality such as processing flows and store measurements data to OpenNMS Newts.
The Sentinel requires a Minion.
It processes flow and streaming telemetry data received by one or more Minions.
If you are using Minions to receive flow and/or streaming telemetry and need to scale processing capacity, you need Sentinel.

As your flow and streaming telemetry volumes increase, additional Sentinel containers can be spawned to meet your processing needs.

In most cases, you can disable adapters and listeners in {page-component-title} that are also run by a Sentinel instance.

This section describes how to install the Sentinel.
