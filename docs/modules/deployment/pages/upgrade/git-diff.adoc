= Manage Configuration Changes with Git

This content was originally written on the OpenNMS Discourse forum (see https://opennms.discourse.group/t/managing-configuration-changes-with-git/2327[Managing Configuration Changes with Git]).

If you want to manage your configuration files with Git but haven't used it for version control before, GitHub's https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git[Using Git] tutorial covers the basics.
You can also read https://opennms.discourse.group/t/developing-with-git/2228[Developing with Git] on the OpenNMS Discourse forum.

If you have an existing OpenNMS {page-component-title} installation, check for the `etc-pristine` directory.
If your {page-component-title} environment does not have this directory, you will need to upgrade to a version that does.

IMPORTANT: Remember to stop {page-component-title} before changing files in the `etc-pristine` directory.

== Start with a pristine `etc` directory

[{tabs}]
====
Debian OSes::
+
--
IMPORTANT: `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc` is linked to `/etc/opennms`.
Do not move that folder.
Moving the folder will break the link and cause future upgrades to fail.

Run the following code to prevent breaking the link between folders:

[source, console]
----
cd /usr/share/opennms
mv etc etc_bad
ln -s /etc/opennms etc
----

Run the following code to move your customized configuration files to `/etc/opennms.bak` and replace them with the contents of `etc-pristine`:

[source, console]
----
mv /etc/opennms /etc/opennms.bak
cp -pR /usr/share/opennms/share/etc-pristine /etc/opennms
----
--

Other OSes::
+
--
Run the following code to move your `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc` files to a safe place, then copy `etc-pristine` to the `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc` directory:

[source, console]
----
mv $OPENNMS_HOME/etc $OPENNMS_HOME/etc.bak
cp -pR $OPENNMS_HOME/share/etc-pristine $OPENNMS_HOME/etc
----

NOTE: On RPM-based installations, the pristine configuration files are located in `$OPENNMS_HOME/share/etc-pristine`.

== Initialize Git

Run the code below to turn your `etc` directory into a Git repository and add the pristine files as your first commit:

[source, console]
----
cd $OPENNMS_HOME/etc
git init
cat << EOF > $OPENNMS_HOME/etc/.gitignore
foreign-sources/
imports/
examples/
include
*.dpkg-old
opennms-upgrade-status.properties
libraries.properties
pluginManifestData.xml
org.opennms.features.datachoices.cfg
include
configured
EOF
git add .
git commit -m "Initial checkin of OpenNMS x.x.x configuration."
----

Replace the `x.x.x` in the last line with your current {page-component-title} version.

== Create branch

Run the code below to create a new branch in your repository:

[source, console]
----
cd $OPENNMS_HOME/etc
git branch local-modifications
git checkout local-modifications
----

[[make-changes]]
== Make changes

You can now edit your configuration files as you normally would.
If you previously backed up your modified configuration files, you can run this code to restore them:

[source, console]
----
rsync -avr $OPENNMS_HOME/etc.bak/ $OPENNMS_HOME/etc/
----

Any time you want to save your changes to the `etc` directory, run this code to commit them to the branch you created (in this case, `local-modifications`):

[source, console]
----
cd $OPENNMS_HOME/etc
git add .
git commit -m "Added initial discovery ranges."
----

When you are finished modifying your configuration files, you can start {page-component-title}.
