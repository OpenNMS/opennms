. Check for configuration file changes, and update accordingly, using the files you backed up in xref:deployment:upgrade/diff.adoc#run_diff[Idenfity Changed Configuration Files].
+
NOTE: If you upgrade in place, OpenNMS renames any shipped config that conflicts with an existing user-modified config to `.rpmnew` or `.rpmsave`.
Inspect these files manually and reconcile the differences.
Use `diff -Bbw` and `diff -y` to look for changes.
If any `.rpmnew` or `.rpmsave` files exist within the configuration directory, services will not start.

+
[source, console]
----

The message `Upgrade completed successfully!` will confirm the upgrade has completed.
If you do not get this message, check the output of the install command for any error messages.

----
systemctl start opennms.service

This is especially important for pages that use JavaScript heavily (for example, the Requisitions UI).
