= Identify Changed Configuration Files

During an upgrade, {page-component-title} overwrites configuration files, so any customization you may have done will be lost.
You need to back up your customized configuration files so that you can merge them into your upgraded system.

The config-diff tool identifies differences between the default {page-component-title} configuration and what you are running.
Identifying these differences helps you to determine what you need to migrate as part of an upgrade.

Run the config-diff tool in the /bin directory to determine changes from a pristine installation:

[source, console]
----
cd ${OPENNMS_HOME}/bin
./config-diff.sh -d
----

TIP: The colordiff command, available in Debian and Red Hat distributions, colors the output for better legibility of changes.

Note the following in the config-diff.sh output:

 * Files you added
 * Files you modified
 * Files you deleted

Back up the changed and added files so that you can merge them later as part of the upgrade process.
Note the deleted files so that you can remove them after the upgrade.
