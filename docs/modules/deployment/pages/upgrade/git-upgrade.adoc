= Upgrade {page-component-title} with Git

This content was originally written on the OpenNMS Discourse forum (see https://opennms.discourse.group/t/managing-configuration-changes-with-git/2327[Managing Configuration Changes with Git]).
Follow the directions here to upgrade with Git if you xref:deployment:upgrade/git-diff.adoc#git-diff[use Git to manage configuration changes].
The steps below assume you have already set up your xref:deployment:upgrade/git-diff.adoc[configuration folders as a Git repository].

IMPORTANT: Remember to stop {page-component-title} before beginning an upgrade.

== Commit configuration changes

Run the `git status` command to check if changes to the `etc` directory have been committed.
If files have been modified, follow the instructions in xref:deployment:upgrade/git-diff.adoc#make-changes[Make changes] to commit them.

== Switch to pristine branch

Run this code to switch to your repository's `main` branch:

[source, console]
----
git checkout main
----

This reverts your `etc` directory to its pristine condition in preparation for the upgrade.

== Upgrade {page-component-title}

Upgrade your {page-component-title} installation as usual (see xref:deployment:upgrade/basic.adoc[Basic Upgrade Steps]).

After upgrading, run the `git status` command to see any changes to the default configuration files from your repository's `main` branch.
If any files were removed during the upgrade, run the `git rm <filename>` command.
This removes the files from your repository.

Make sure your repository's `main` branch is aligned with the version of {page-component-title} that you upgraded to by adding and committing the changes:

[source, console]
----
git add .
git commit -m 'Upgraded to OpenNMS x.x.x.'
----

Replace the `x.x.x` in the last line with your current {page-component-title} version.

When your `main` branch has been brought up to date, you can switch back to your modified branch:

[source, console]
----
git checkout local-modifications
----

== Apply changes from `main` branch

Update your modified branch by merging your `main` branch into your current working branch (in this example, `local-modifications`):

[source, console]
----
git merge main
----

If Git finds a conflict, the `merge` command generates an error message:

[source, console]
----
git merge main
Removing CHANGELOG
Removing map.disable
Auto-merging surveillance-views.xml
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in surveillance-views.xml
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
----

Run `git status` to check which files have conflicts:

[source, console]
----
git status
# Unmerged paths:
#   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
#   (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
#
#	both modified:      surveillance-views.xml
----

For more information on managing conflicts, see https://opennms.discourse.group/t/managing-configuration-changes-with-git/2327#apply-changes-from-master-14[Managing Configuration Changes with Git].

When you are finished modifying your configuration files, you can start {page-component-title}.
