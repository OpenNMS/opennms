= Develop Documentation

There are different ways to contribute documentation, each suitable for different use cases:

* Publish tutorials and "how to"s in our https://opennms.discourse.group/c/knowledgebase[Discourse knowledge base].
For example, you may want to describe how to use the Net-SNMP agent and the OpenNMS SNMP monitor to solve a special use case.
This is a great way to help other OpenNMS users who might have similar questions, because we sometimes cross-reference these articles in official documentation.
* Contribute formal technical documentation related to the source code on https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms[GitHub].
* Pick up `quickwin-docs` issues from our Jira Documentation backlog.
These are issues that should require only a short amount of time to address.
* Review, suggest improvements for, and provide comments on existing documentation.
* Report bugs, errors, or areas for improvement.

All formal technical documentation should follow a basic structure:

* A descriptive title (for example, "Create a Minion" or "SnmpCollector").
* A brief description of the subject being documented.
* Procedure steps and technical content such as parameters, configuration, and examples, as appropriate.

Minimize the use of screenshots; they should be included only to illustrate a concept that may be difficult to understand, or something that is not easy to locate in the UI.
See the <<write-docs.adoc#ga-opennms-docs-images, Images>> section for more information.

== Documentation file structure

All OpenNMS projects that have documentation include it in the `docs` directory.
Within this directory, you will find the `./modules` directory, which contains all technical documentation associated with the source code in the repository.
The `./modules` directory may have more nested directories to create a hierarchy for the content (for example, components and subcomponents).

You will find `.adoc` files in the `./pages` directory or one of its subdirectories, and image files in the `./images` directory or one of its subdirectories.
The following table describes the documentation modules for the Horizon project:

[options="autowidth"]
|===
| Directory | Contents

| docs/modules/deployment
| Documentation on how to install and configure Horizon on different operating systems.

| docs/modules/development
| Documentation for those who want to develop Horizon.

| docs/modules/operation
| Documentation for administrators to configure, optimize, and run Horizon.

| docs/modules/reference
| Glossary and miscellaneous configuration topics.

| docs/modules/releasenotes
| Changelog and release notes.

| docs/modules/write-the-docs
| Documentation on how to write documentation for the Horizon project.
|===

NOTE: Documentation for other OpenNMS projects (for example, `opennms-alec`) follows a similar hierarchy, as appropriate for the project.

Every new directory or `.adoc` file must be included in the general structure of the documentation, defined by the `nav.adoc` files:

. Create a new `.adoc` file (in this example, `dosc/modules/operation/pages/meta-data.adoc`).
. Open the directory's `nav.adoc` file (in this example, `docs/modules/operation/nav.adoc`).
. Add a new bullet list entry linking to the new page.
+
In this example, `meta-data.adoc` is located in the main `/operation/pages` directory, so you should add it as a level-one list item.
If the document is located in a sub-directory (for example, `/operation/pages/admin`), you should add it as a level-two list item, and so on.
To add a new level-one list item, use the following syntax:
+
.Level-one `nav.adoc` list item with defined hyperlink text
[source, asciidoc]
----
* xref:meta-data.adoc[Meta Data]
----
+
If you choose not to define the hyperlink text within the square brackets, the link will use the top-level heading in the specified file.

. Save your changes and commit them to your active repository branch.

To test your changes locally, xref:build-docs.adoc[build the documentation].
