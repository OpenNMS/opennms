= Write the Docs

The OpenNMS Group Technical Writing Style Guide is the set of standards for writing our content, to make it consistent and intuitive.
The OpenNMS software is free and open source, and we welcome any kind of contribution.
If you didn't find something in the docs, or you noticed a page that can be expanded upon, feel free to contribute.

Please observe the rules and guidelines outlined here to maintain consistency across the projects.

We use Antora and the AsciiDoc file format (`.adoc`) to create our documentation.
For information on syntax, see Antora's https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/asciidoc/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc Primer] guide.

== External style guides

We follow the guidelines established in the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/[Microsoft Writing Style Guide].
