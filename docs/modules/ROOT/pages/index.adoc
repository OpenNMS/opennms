OpenNMS {page-component-title} is an open source solution that helps you visualize and monitor everything on your local and remote networks.
It offers comprehensive fault, performance, traffic monitoring, and alarm generation in one place.
Highly customizable and scalable, {page-component-title} easily integrates with your core business applications and workflows.

{page-component-title} bundles OpenNMS's core platform, Minion (remote distributed monitoring), Sentinel (scalability), and Newts (time-series database) technologies with other open source components:

* Apache https://kafka.apache.org/[Kafka] or https://activemq.apache.org/[ActiveMQ] (message brokers)
* https://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSQL] (database)
* https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/[Elasticsearch] (search and analytics engine)
* Apache https://cassandra.apache.org/[Cassandra] (time-series data storage)
* https://grafana.com/[Grafana] and https://www.elastic.co/kibana[Kibana] (for dashboard creation)

to collect, present, and store network monitoring information.

{page-component-title} collects data on the devices, interfaces, and services you define during provisioning.
It triggers alarms when it detects a problem, and also stores the metrics it collects over a long period of time.
Not only can you monitor and troubleshoot problems on your local and remote networks, you can also analyze trends and anticipate problems for better capacity management and network optimization.
