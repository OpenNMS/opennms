== Release 31.0.9

Release 31.0.9 contains one CVE-related security fix, a generous helping of other bug fixes, and a several small enhancements intended to improve supportability.

The codename for Horizon 31.0.9 is https://wikipedia.org/wiki/$$Ballokume$$[_Ballokume_].

=== Breaking changes

* This release has moved to a newer major version of Spring Security to address a number of CVEs, which necessitated changes to the `$OPENNMS_HOME/jetty-webapps/opennms/WEB-INF/applicationContext-spring-security.xml` file, so if you have modified this file in your installs, be sure to note your changes so you can re-apply them to the updated version.
* The script `$OPENNMS_HOME/bin/install` checked whether `$myser` equals `$RUNAS` before sourcing `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/opennms.conf`, which caused startup to fail every time unless the script were run as root; if you have patched that file on your system, watch out for a `.rpmsave` or `.dpkg-new` file.

[[releasenotes-changelog-31.0.4]]

== Release 31.0.4

Release 31.0.4 introduces **one breaking change** (see below). It also brings a handful of containerization improvements, fixes several security vulnerabilities, upgrades many potentially vulnerable dependency libraries, fixes one bug in the BSM daemon, and fixes many non-security bugs.

=== Breaking changes

* The `GpDetector` and `ScriptPolicy` now require that their scripts be located beneath `$OPENNMS_HOME` and beneath `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/script-policies`, respectively. If you are using either of these classes in your foreign-source definitions, please address this requirement before upgrading to this release.

=== Known issues

The following known issues impact Horizon 31.0.4; we expect all to be fixed in the next micro-version release:

* Regular users are unable to acknowledge or clear alarms from the geographical map's integrated alarm browser. Until we identify a fix, it is possible to work around this problem by adding `ROLE_REST` to a user's set of assigned roles. See https://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-15080[NMS-15080] for details. Thanks to Ricardo Monteiro for bringing this problem to our attention.
* On systems where dual-write time series persisting is enabled, an intermittent startup problem may cause either a delay in data starting to be persisted, or a hard failure necessitating a restarting of the core. See https://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-15326[NMS-15326] for details.
* The ALEC plugin currently cannot be successfully installed on a Sentinel node. At release time, it is unclear whether the problem lies in Sentinel or in ALEC. Some details are captured in https://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-15396[NMS-15396].

=== Shout-outs and errata

* Thanks to researcher Baharuddin Zulkifli of https://www.netbytesec.com[NetbyteSEC] for reporting https://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-14854[several cross-site scripting vulnerabilities].
* Thanks to researcher Stefan Schiller of https://www.sonarsource.com/[SonarSource] for reporting https://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-14878[a pair of authenticated command-injection vulnerabilities].
* Thanks to Ricardo Monteiro for bringing the geo-map alarms problem https://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-15080[NMS-15080] to our attention.
* The release notes for 31.0.3 incorrectly stated that https://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-15124[NMS-15124] was fixed in that release. In actual fact, the fix is in this release (31.0.4).

[[releasenotes-changelog-31.0.1]]

== Release 31.0.1

Release 31.0.1 is a small out-of-band release to address some issues found during 31.0.0 testing.

It contains a few small changes including a fix for unusually large docker images and some other small bug fixes,
as well as some updates to the new Quick Start Guide and a fix to the installation instructions for the Cortex plugin.

Please note there is a known issue that only one plugin entry shows up in the navigation bar's "Plugins" menu, even if multiple plugins are installed.
Only ALEC users who install the cloud connector are impacted.
ALEC users therefore should avoid the Cloud Services Connector plugin until a new release fixes the underlying bug.
