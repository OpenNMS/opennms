= What's New in OpenNMS Horizon 34

== Breaking changes
The default time series storage strategy is now by default RRDTool.

IMPORTANT: If you use JRobin, make sure you set the property.
You can easily verify it by checking the file extension created in the directory  `${OPENNMS_HOME}/share/rrd/snmp`. The extension .jrb indicates JRobin and .rrd indicates RRDtool.
If you miss this setting, all your timeseries files will be newely created as .rrd files and you won't have access to your JRobin files with your history.

IMPORTANT: When you have .jrb files, ensure after upgrading to Horizon 34 you explicitly configure JRobin in a file like `${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/opennms.properties.d/timeseries.properties`.

.Configure explicitly JRobin for Horizon 34.x if required

== Deprecation of JRobin as timeseries storage

The release of Horizon 34 will be the last version which supports reading and writing timeseries data using JRobin.
The JRobin library and the JRobin timeseries strategy will be removed from Horizon 35+ moving forward.
