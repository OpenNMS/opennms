= What's New in OpenNMS Horizon 29

== System Requirements

* *Java 11*: OpenNMS Horizon 29 runs on JDK 11.
* *PostgreSQL 10 or higher*: Horizon 29 requires any supported version of PostgreSQL from 10 up to (and including) 14.

== Breaking Changes

=== Running as Non-Root

By default, OpenNMS now runs as the `opennms` user rather than `root`.

WARNING: If you are upgrading from a version of OpenNMS Horizon older than 29, you will have to fix the ownership of your files.

==== Fixing Permissions and Ownership

Since many OpenNMS instances are very large with thousands or even millions of RRD and similar data files in `$OPENNMS_HOME/share`,
we decided _not_ to change ownership automatically upon package upgrade.

The OpenNMS installer will detect if you need to fix the ownership of your files and warn you to run the script to fix permissions
(`$OPENNMS_HOME/bin/fix-permissions`) in this case.

If you wish to revert to the previous behavior, create an `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/opennms.conf` file if it doesn't already exist, and set `RUNAS`.

[source, shell]
----
RUNAS=root

==== Trapd Port Changes

As OpenNMS can no longer listen on privileged ports by default, the default Trapd port is now `10162`.
You will need to configure a proxy agent or port forward to continue to receive traps at port `162`.
Otherwise, you must configure your agents to send traps to the new port instead.

==== Java ICMP Permissions

OpenNMS will attempt to configure ICMP permissions using the `net.ipv4.ping_group_range` sysctl.
However, Linux kernels older than version 3.11 (like the version provided by CentOS 7) do not support this setting fully.

If you are on a distribution with an older unsupported kernel, you can give Java ICMP permissions using the `setcap` utility once you have completed your upgrade.
Note that this example assumes you have already run `$OPENNMS_HOME/bin/install` after install or upgrade, so `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/java.conf` exists.

[source, shell]
----
setcap cap_net_raw+ep $(</opt/opennms/etc/java.conf) && echo "$(dirname $(</opt/opennms/etc/java.conf))/../lib/jli/" > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/java.conf && ldconfig -v

=== Additional configuration needed when using Kafka/gRPC for Minion communication.

The Twin API has replaced the OpenNMS REST API for synchronizing Trapd configuration updates.
Additional settings are needed on both Minion and {page-component-title} to enable Twin when not using the ActiveMQ message broker.

Refer to the deployment section in the documentation for details.


=== SQS Minion IPC Support Dropped

Support for Amazon SQS for Minion communication has been removed.
We recommend to instead use Kafka for use cases that require horizontal scaling of Minion communication.

=== Time Series Integration Layer Changes

The Time Series integration layer has gone through link:https://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-13356[a number of big improvements] to reduce the complexity and cardinality of metadata and tags.

* Time series plugins need to be compatible with OIA 0.6.x.
* Resource level string attributes are now also stored via the plugin in the respective time series database.
  The `timeseries_meta` table which previously stored this metadata has been removed.
  There is no migration; string values are generally updated on the next poll.

== New Features and Improvements

=== Flows and Nephron

Nephron and flow processing have gone through a number of major enhancements.

* Flow metadata has been tuned and redundancy has been removed, resulting in less
  data being stored per update.
* Elasticsearch persistence has been improved to support batching updates.
* The flow classification engine has been almost entirely rewritten to be
  considerably more performant when processing large rulesets.
* Support has been added for persisting flows to Cortex.

=== Minion

The Minion continues to receive improvements in performance and features, most notably the addition of a new API (the "Twin API"), which pushes configuration to Minion over RPC, reducing the amount of data that needs to be passed over the wire.

The first subsystem to adopt this new API is SNMPv3 auth data, so the Minion no longer needs to make a REST call to the OpenNMS core.
Over time, all configuration information will be migrated to this new API.

=== Polling and Metadata

* Threshold metadata link:https://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-12689[is now validated].
* Kafka producer payloads now contain link:https://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-13191[additional useful resource metadata].
* Monitor status can now link:https://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-13324[optionally be persisted to RRD] so that it can be retrieved using the Measurements API.
* The `wsman-config.xml` link:https://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-13468[is now validated].

=== Provisioning

* A link:https://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-13313[`localhost` node is now monitored] and enumerates some useful OpenNMS metrics by default.
* LLDP scanning in Enlinkd has link:https://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-13593[added support for `TIMETRA-LLDP-MIB`].

=== GeoIP Provisioning Adapter
You can use the GeoIP Provisioning Adapter to enrich a node's asset data with location information.
It uses the GeoIP2 Databases from MaxMind to look up longitude/latitude values for a given IP address.

=== REST API

* RTC data now includes link:https://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-13238[an additional boolean field] for service up/down status.

=== Documentation

* A ton of work has gone into cleaning up, rearranging, and standardizing terms in the documentation.
* A bunch of additional REST APIs are now documented through OpenAPI.

== Important Internal Changes

* Kafka components have been updated to version 2.8.0
* Our embedded Karaf has been updated to version 4.3.2
