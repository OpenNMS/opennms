== New features and important changes

=== Removed JRobin implementation

JRobin, the pure-Java RRD implementation has been removed.
The class `org.opennms.netmgt.rrd.jrobin.JRobinRrdStrategy` is no longer available.
The Utilities to convert and analyze JRobin files (`.jrb`) are still available and usable.

=== Simplified Datasource Configuration
The `opennms-datasources.xml` configuration file has been simplified by making the `factory` and `class-name` attributes optional with sensible defaults. The `factory` attribute now defaults to `org.opennms.core.db.HikariCPConnectionFactory` and the `class-name` attribute defaults to `org.postgresql.Driver`. Existing configurations with these attributes explicitly set will continue to work unchanged. New installations and users updating their configurations can omit these attributes for cleaner, more maintainable configuration files.

=== Simplified Service Configuration

The `service-configuration.xml` configuration file has been simplified by moving service implementation details (class names, attributes, and invoke methods) to defaults in the classpath. Users now only need to specify the service name and enabled status. A complete reference configuration is available in `etc/examples/service-configuration.xml.default`. Existing configurations continue to work unchanged.

=== Removed TestLoadLibraries Service

The `TestLoadLibraries` service has been removed as a separate service entry in `service-configuration.xml`. Its functionality (testing ICMP and localhost resolution) is now executed automatically as part of the Manager service initialization. This simplifies the service configuration and reduces the number of service entries that must be managed.

=== OpenConfig Support on Minion

OpenConfig telemetry streaming is now supported on Minion. See xref:reference:telemetryd/protocols/openconfig.adoc#minion-setup[Set up OpenConfig on Minion] for configuration details.

== Breaking changes
With this release, we’re streamlining the installation process for OpenNMS on both Debian and RPM-based systems by standardizing the installation location to /opt/opennms. This update provides a consistent deployment path, simplifies future upgrades, and minimizes conflicts caused by differing directories.
Before upgrading, we strongly recommend backing up your existing installation—including configuration files, databases, and any custom scripts or integrations—to prevent data loss or disruption.
