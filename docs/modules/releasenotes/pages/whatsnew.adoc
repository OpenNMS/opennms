== What's New in OpenNMS Horizon 28

=== System Requirements

* *Java 8 through 11*: OpenNMS Horizon 28 runs on JDK 8 through 11.
  We recommend the most recent version of OpenJDK 11.
* *PostgreSQL 10 or higher*: Horizon 28 requires any supported version of PostgreSQL from 10 up to (and including) 13.

=== Breaking Changes

==== Kafka RPC Enables single topic configuration by default.

Enables single topic by default for Kafka RPC which would reduce number of topics on Kafka.
Both Minion and OpenNMS need to be updated to OpenNMS Horizon 28.
Make sure that Kafka Lag on Sink topics be minimal before upgrading otherwise there may be loss of those sink messages.

==== Situation Feedback Persistence Configuration

The configuration file `etc/org.opennms.features.situation-feedback.persistence.elastic.cfg` is renamed to `etc/org.opennms.features.situationfeedback.persistence.elastic.cfg`, i.e. the minus sign is removed from the filename.
