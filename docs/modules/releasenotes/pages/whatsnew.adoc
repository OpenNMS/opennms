= What's New in OpenNMS Horizon 31

== System requirements

* *Java 11*: OpenNMS Horizon 31 runs on JDK 11.
* *PostgreSQL 10 or higher*: Horizon 31 requires any supported version of PostgreSQL from 10 up to (and including) 15.

== New features and improvements

=== OpenNMS Plugins

Horizon 31 supports plugins using the OpenNMS Plugin API version 1.0 through 1.2.

Since 1.0, OPA has been improved to include time-series performance enhancements and off-heap support,
APIs for flow persistence and poller configuration extensions, and enhanced event and monitored service metadata.

==== Cloud Services Connector with Time Series DB Support

Horizon 31 includes the https://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-14471[Cloud Services Connector] in its default RPM
and DEB install, providing access to OpenNMS Time Series DB – a new hosted cloud service which enables scalable
metrics storage without the administrative overhead.

==== Cortex Time-Series Plugin

Horizon 31.0.0 is the first new major Horizon release to support writing time-series data to a Cortex
instance via the optional https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms-cortex-tss-plugin[OpenNMS Cortex Plugin].

=== UI Preview Integration

The "UI Preview" that was separate from the main UI in Horizon 30 has been
https://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-14730[integrated into the main web UI] where appropriate for Horizon 31.

=== Topology Improvements

Network topology discovery ("Enlinkd") has received https://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-14883[significant refactoring]
to make it smarter and more performant.

=== Containers

==== Container Cleanup and Refactoring

The work done in Horizon 30, cleaning up and standardizing how our container images are built, has been
expanded in Horizon 31.
All images (Horizon, Minion, and Sentinel) use the same core, and are now available in amd64, arm64, and arm7 varieties.

==== OpenShift Support

Horizon 30 was incompatible with OpenShift, and we have addressed these issues.
If you see any weird permissions or ownership problems in an OpenShift environment, log an issue report in https://issues.opennms.com/[Jira].

=== Collection and Thresholding

* configurations have been added for thresholding on Collectd and Pollerd threads

=== Device Configuration Backup

The DCB feature has had a number of improvements, including debugging and script enhancements.

=== REST API

* The REST API endpoint for configuring external requisitions (aka `requisition-def`s) has been improved to
  enable targeted updates rather than requiring whole posting of a new configuration.


=== Documentation

As usual, our documentation team has been doing tons of work cleaning up and improving the documentation.
The biggest addition is a new Quick Start Guide that provides simple steps to set up basic monitoring with a minimal configuration of Horizon.

== Breaking Changes

* support for the XML Management Protocol (XMP) has been removed
* security-related HTTP headers (Strict-Transport-Security, Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, Permissions-Policy, Referrer-Policy) were added in `web.xml`

=== SNMP4J upgrade
The SNMP4J library has been upgraded to version 2.8.15.
As part of this upgrade, the SNMP4J logger configuration in opennms.properties has been updated to use the SLF4J logging implementation:

`snmp4j.LogFactory=org.opennms.netmgt.snmp.snmp4j.Slf4jLogFactory`

NOTE: If you are upgrading from an older version and have overridden this property (e.g., still using org.snmp4j.log.Log4jLogFactory), you must update it manually. Retaining the old value may cause OpenNMS to fail to start
