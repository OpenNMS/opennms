== New features and improvements

=== Newts: DataStax driver for Cassandra upgrade

The DataStax driver for Cassandra was updated from version 3.x to 4.x.
This allows us to introduce the following functionality:

. Set additional Cassandra driver settings using system properties (for example, you can set `datastax-java-driver.basic.request.timeout="30 seconds"` to configure the connection timeout).
See https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/4.0/manual/core/configuration/[Configuration] in the official DataStax documentation for details.

. Configure all driver settings using an external file.
To do so, set the following system properties in `newts-on-cassandra.conf`:
+
[source, properties]
----
org.opennms.newts.config.keyspace=newts
org.opennms.newts.config.driver_settings_file=/opt/opennms/etc/newts-on-cassandra.conf
----

** For example, a minimal version of the file would resemble the following snippet:
+
[source, ]
----
datastax-java-driver {
  basic.contact-points = [ "127.0.0.1:9042" ]
  session-name = "default"
  session-keyspace = "newnewts"
  basic.load-balancing-policy {
    local-datacenter = datacenter1
  }
}
----

** See https://github.com/datastax/java-driver/blob/4.0.1/core/src/main/resources/reference.conf[reference.conf] in the DataStax GitHub repository for a complete example.

=== Native Holt-Winters forecasting

The Holt-Winters forecasting filter no longer depends on the `R` package, and has been converted to Java.
This leverages adaptive alerting work done by the team at https://github.com/ExpediaGroup/adaptive-alerting[Expedia].
You can continue to use the filter as-is; no changes are needed to use this forecasting method.

The filter that depends on the `R` package will be discontinued in a future release.

== Breaking changes

=== Newts: DataStax driver for Cassandra upgrade

The DataStax driver for Cassandra was updated from version 3.x to 4.x.
This introduces the following breaking changes:

. `org.opennms.newts.config.datacenter` is now required.
Set this to the value of your local datacenter for the best performance.
. `org.opennms.newts.config.core-connections-per-host` and `org.opennms.newts.config.max-connections-per-host` have been removed.
Use `org.opennms.newts.config.connections-per-host` to configure the number of connections per host.

=== JMX MBean name changes

Because of an upgrade of the Dropwizard Metrics library, some JMX MBeans object names have changed.
The built-in data collection configurations have been updated to use the new object names, and will continue to work as-is.
If you have other collections, or you are otherwise relying on MBeans, you may need to adjust the object references there.
For example, org.opennms.newts:name=search.update,type=timers` has become `org.opennms.newts:name=search.update,type=timers`, and the `type` attribute has been added to the object.

=== Everything

Sorry!
