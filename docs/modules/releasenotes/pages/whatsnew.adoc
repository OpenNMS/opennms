= What's New in OpenNMS Horizon 34

== New features and important changes

=== Node Cache configuration

Due to a refactoring to enable the collection of IPFix metrics, the node cache has been moved to another module.
The configuration of the cache is now stored in the file `org.opennms.features.telemetry.protocols.common.cfg` and no longer in the file `org.opennms.features.flows.persistence.elastic.cfg`.

=== `install.sh` script clears data directory and restores Karaf-related configuration files
To overcome common upgrading problems, the data directory is automatically pruned when invoking the `install.sh` script.
Furthermore, all Karaf-related configuration files are restored to their pristine state.

=== OpenNMS Plugin API

The OpenNMS Plugin API has been updated to version 1.6.0, which includes some new APIs ported over from the Horizon codebase to simplify plugin development, as well as cleanups to dependencies.
It also includes some fixes to the protocol list used by Enlinkd.

=== Expanded metadata support

It is now possible to use the metadata DSL in nearly all configuration files.
For details on all of the subsystems that support the metadata DSL, see xref:operation:deep-dive/meta-data.adoc[the operation manual].

=== Confd improvements

Support for `confd` has been added to the Sentinel container.

=== UI: structured node list

An enhanced node list has been introduced with options for sorting and filtering.

== Breaking changes
The default time series storage strategy is now by default RRDTool.

IMPORTANT: If you use JRobin, make sure you set the property.
You can easily verify it by checking the file extension created in the directory  `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/share/rrd/snmp`. The extension .jrb indicates JRobin and .rrd indicates RRDtool.
If you miss this setting, all your timeseries files will be newely created as .rrd files and you won't have access to your JRobin files with your history.

IMPORTANT: When you have .jrb files, ensure after upgrading to Horizon 34 you explicitly configure JRobin in a file like `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/opennms.properties.d/timeseries.properties`.

== Deprecation of JRobin as timeseries storage

The release of Horizon 34 will be the last version which supports reading and writing timeseries data using JRobin.
The JRobin library and the JRobin timeseries strategy will be removed from Horizon 35+ moving forward.

=== OpenNMS Minion environment variables changes
The OpenNMS Minion Docker container no longer uses the KAFKA_SINK, KAFKA_RPC and KAFKA_TWIN prefixes to configure Kafka.
Instead, only the KAFKA_IPC prefix is used, which ensures that all Kafka-related settings are set correctly for all features and that ActiveMQ is no longer installed incorrectly.

=== Secure Credentials Vault changes
The `Secure Credentials Vault` in `OpenNMS` traditionally supported the `JCEKS` keystore format. As of the latest enhancement,
support has been added for the `PKCS12` keystore format.

Set `org.opennms.features.scv.jceks.keystore.type=PKCS12` in configuration file
 `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/opennms.properties.d/scv.properties.`

If you want to convert the `PKCS12` keystore format instead of `JCEKS`, be sure to update the file extension to match the new format (e.g., use `.pk12` instead of `.jce`).
You can convert a `JCEKS` file to `PKCS12` using the following command.
`keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore $OPENNMS_HOME/etc/scv.jce -destkeystore $OPENNMS_HOME/etc/scv.pk12 -deststoretype pkcs12`.
