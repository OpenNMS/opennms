== New features and important changes
=== Time To Value Improvements to the Menu Structure ===

One of our 2025-26 goals is to reduce the time it takes a new user, from learning about our product to discovering and visualizing the status of their network infrastructure. Our first step in this approach is the re-organization of the menu structure, with a responsive side menu that streamlines the IT Operatorâ€™s actions. Stay tuned for other inprovements in the near futrue such as: OVA Virtual Appliance Support, Adding Windows Management Interface Nodes right from the Quick Add Node, and better Structured Node List navigation.

=== Service NOW Plugin (Meridian Subscription Required) ===

For our Meridian customers, you can now forward your alarms to Service NOW. You can also populate an OpenNMS requisition with the configuration items (nodes) managed by Service NOW, avoiding blind spots in your management strategy.

=== Support for Zenith and Zenith Connect (Meridian Subscription Required) ===

For our Meridian customers, you can now enjoy our new Zenith single pane of glass, where you can view all of your alarms, from multiple Meridians or even 3rd party applications. From there you can direct these alarms to the appropiate IT Operator via our new Notifications Manager.

This connection is TLS secured and authenticated.

=== Cortex fixes ===
Performance improvements.  Cortex and Prometheus-based databases recommended for systems with a large number of devices.

=== Thanos ??? ===

=== Node Cache configuration

Due to a refactoring to enable the collection of IPFix metrics, the node cache has been moved to another module.
The configuration of the cache is now stored in the file `org.opennms.features.telemetry.protocols.common.cfg` and no longer in the file `org.opennms.features.flows.persistence.elastic.cfg`.

=== `install.sh` script clears data directory and restores Karaf-related configuration files
To overcome common upgrading problems, the data directory is automatically pruned when invoking the `install.sh` script.
Furthermore, all Karaf-related configuration files are restored to their pristine state.

=== OpenNMS Plugin API

The OpenNMS Plugin API has been updated to version 1.6.0, which includes some new APIs ported over from the Horizon codebase to simplify plugin development, as well as cleanups to dependencies.
It also includes some fixes to the protocol list used by Enlinkd.

=== Expanded metadata support

It is now possible to use the metadata DSL in nearly all configuration files.
For details on all of the subsystems that support the metadata DSL, see xref:operation:deep-dive/meta-data.adoc[the operation manual].

=== Confd improvements

Support for `confd` has been added to the Sentinel container.

=== UI: structured node list

An enhanced node list has been introduced with options for sorting and filtering.

== Breaking changes
The default time series storage strategy is now by default RRDTool.

IMPORTANT: If you use JRobin, make sure you set the property.
You can easily verify it by checking the file extension created in the directory  `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/share/rrd/snmp`. The extension .jrb indicates JRobin and .rrd indicates RRDtool.
If you miss this setting, all your timeseries files will be newely created as .rrd files and you won't have access to your JRobin files with your history.

IMPORTANT: When you have .jrb files, ensure after upgrading to Horizon 34 you explicitly configure JRobin in a file like `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/opennms.properties.d/timeseries.properties`.

.Configure explicitly JRobin for Horizon 34.x if required

== Deprecation of JRobin as timeseries storage

The release of Horizon 34 will be the last version which supports reading and writing timeseries data using JRobin.
The JRobin library and the JRobin timeseries strategy will be removed from Horizon 35+ moving forward.


== Deprecation of Tl1d
The Tl1d service has been deprecated and removed from service configuration due to low user adoption. The service code will be fully removed in the next Horizon/Meridian release.

== Deprecation of AsteriskGateway
The AsteriskGateway service has been deprecated and removed from service configuration due to low user adoption. The service code will be fully removed in the next Horizon/Meridian release.

== Deprecation of Reportd service

The Reportd service has been deprecated and removed from service configuration due to low user adoption. The service code will be fully removed in the next Horizon/Meridian release.


=== OpenNMS Minion environment variables changes
The OpenNMS Minion Docker container no longer uses the KAFKA_SINK, KAFKA_RPC and KAFKA_TWIN prefixes to configure Kafka.
Instead, only the KAFKA_IPC prefix is used, which ensures that all Kafka-related settings are set correctly for all features and that ActiveMQ is no longer installed incorrectly.

=== Secure Credentials Vault changes
The `Secure Credentials Vault` in `OpenNMS` traditionally supported the `JCEKS` keystore format. As of the latest enhancement,
support has been added for the `PKCS12` keystore format.

Set `org.opennms.features.scv.keystore.type=PKCS12` in configuration file
 `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/opennms.properties.d/scv.properties.`

If you want to convert the `PKCS12` keystore format instead of `JCEKS`, be sure to update the file extension to match the new format (e.g., use `.pk12` instead of `.jce`).
You can convert a `JCEKS` file to `PKCS12` using the following command.
`keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore $OPENNMS_HOME/etc/scv.jce -destkeystore $OPENNMS_HOME/etc/scv.pk12 -deststoretype pkcs12`.
