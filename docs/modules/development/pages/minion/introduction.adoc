= Minion

A Minion is an instance of the Karaf OSGi service that enables OpenNMS to monitor devices and services in locations that OpenNMS cannot reach. 
Minions communicate with these remote devices while OpenNMS performs coordination and task delegation.

Minions can operate behind a firewall and/or network address translation (NAT) as long as they can communicate with OpenNMS via ActiveMQ or Apache Kafka. 

This section provides information to help developers get started with writing Minion-related features.
It is not intended to be an exhaustive overview of the Minion architecture or feature set.
