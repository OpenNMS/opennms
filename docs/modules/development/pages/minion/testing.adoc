= Testing

This sections describes how developers can test features on the Minion container.

== Local Testing

You can compile, assemble, and spawn an interactive shell on the Minion container using:

.Assemble and run the container in place
[source, bash]
----
cd features/minion && ./runInPlace.sh
----

== System Tests

The runtime environment of the Minion container and features differs greatly from that provided by the unit and integration tests.
For this reason, it is important to perform automated end-to-end testing of the features.

The system tests provide a framework that lets developers instantiate a complete Docker-based Minion system using a single JUnit rule.

For further details, see the https://github.com/OpenNMS/minion-system-tests[minion-system-tests] project on GitHub.
