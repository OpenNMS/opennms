= Requisitions

RESTful service to the {page-component-title} Provisioning Requisitions.
In this API, these "groups" of nodes are aptly named and treated as requisitions.

This current implementation supports CRUD operations for managing provisioning requisitions.
Requisitions are first POSTed and no provisioning (import/synchronize) operations are taken.
This is done so that a) the XML can be verified and b) so that the operations can happen at a later time.
They are moved to the deployed state (put in the active requisition repository) when an import is run.

If a request says that it gets the active requisition, that means it returns the pending requisition (being edited for deployment) if there is one, otherwise it returns the deployed requisition.
Note that anything that says it adds/deletes/modifies a node, interface, etc. in these instructions is referring to modifying that element from the requisition, not from the database itself.
That will happen upon import/synchronization.

You may write requisition data if the authenticated user is in the provision, rest, or admin roles.

| `/requisitions/{name}/nodes/{foreignId}/interfaces`                      | Adds (or replaces) an interface for the given node in the specified requisition.
| `/requisitions/{name}/nodes/{foreignId}/interfaces/{ipAddress}/services` | Adds (or replaces) a service on the given interface in the specified requisition.
| `/requisitions/{name}/nodes/{foreignId}/categories`                      | Adds (or replaces) a category for the given node in the specified requisition.
| `/requisitions/{name}/nodes/{foreignId}/assets`                          | Adds (or replaces) an asset for the given node in the specified requisition.

| Resource                                                        | Description
| `/requisitions/{name}/import`                                   | Performs an import/synchronize on the specified foreign source. This turns the "active" requisition into the "deployed" requisition.
| `/requisitions/{name}/import?rescanExisting=false`              | Performs an import/synchronize on the specified foreign source. This turns the "active" requisition into the "deployed" requisition. Existing nodes will not be scanned until the next rescan interval, only newly-added nodes will be. Useful if you plan to make a series of changes.
| `/requisitions/{name}`                                          | Update the specified foreign source.
