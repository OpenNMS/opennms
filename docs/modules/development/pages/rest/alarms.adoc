NOTE: the default offset is 0, the default limit is 10 results. To get all results, use `limit=0` as a parameter on the URL (ie, `GET /events?limit=0`).

== GETs (Reading Data)

[options="header", cols="5,10"]
|===
| Resource        | Description
| `/alarms`       | Get a list of alarms.
| `/alarms/count` | Get the number of alarms. (Returns plaintext, rather than XML or JSON.)
| `/alarms/\{id}` | Get the alarms specified by the given ID.
|===

Note that you can also query by severity, like so:

[options="header", cols="5,10"]
|===
| Resource                                   | Description
| `/alarms?comparator=ge&amp;severity=MINOR` | Get the alarms with a severity greater than or equal to MINOR.
|===

== PUTs (Modifying Data)

PUT requires form data using application/x-www-form-urlencoded as a Content-Type.

[options="header", cols="5,10"]
|===
| Resource                               | Description
| `/alarms/\{id}?ack=''(true;false)''`   | Acknowledges (or unacknowledges) an alarm.
| `/alarms?x=y&...&ack=''(true;false)''` | Acknowledges (or unacknowledges) alarms matching the additional query parameters. e.g., `/alarms?node.id=4&ack=true`
| `/alarms/\{id}?clear=true`             | Clears an alarm.
| `/alarms/\{id}?escalate=true`          | Escalates an alarm (for example, NORMAL -> MINOR, MAJOR -> CRITICAL)
| `/alarms?x=y&...&clear=true`           | Clears alarms matching the additional query parameters.
| `/alarms?x=y&...&escalate=true`        | Escalates alarms matching the additional query parameters.
|===

Additionally, when acknowledging alarms (ack=true) you can specify an `ackUser` parameter.
You will only be allowed to `ack` as a different user IF you are PUTting as an authenticated user who is in the admin role.

== v2 API

Since Horizon 20.1.0, an alarms endpoint has been available in the v2 API that uses link:https://github.com/jirutka/rsql-parser#rsql--fiql-parser[FIQL] for querying.

Examples:

* `/api/v2/alarms?_s=alarm.reductionKey==uei.opennms.org/nodes/nodeDown::*`
* `/api/v2/alarms?_s=alarm.uei==uei.opennms.org/nodes/nodeDown`
* `/api/v2/alarms?_s=alarm.ipAddr==127.0.0.1`
* `/api/v2/alarms?_s=node.label==localhost`

NOTE: If your query string includes a FIQL reserved character like a comma (,) or a semicolon (;) you need to double percent-escape it.

Suppose you have a service with a comma in the name, like `COMMA,SERVICE` and you want to retrieve all the alarms for its failure.
Your query would look like `/api/v2/alarms?_s=alarm.reductionKey==uei.opennms.org/nodes/nodeLostService::*:COMMA%252CSERVICE`.
