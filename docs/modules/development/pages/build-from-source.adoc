= Build from Source

We highly recommend running a *nix system to build OpenNMS from source code.
You do not need to run it physically; a virtual machine is sufficient.
Our community uses the following environments to develop our software:

* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions#Debian-based[Debian-based] operating system
* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions#RPM-based[RPM-based] operating system
* Mac OS X

This section describes how to build OpenNMS {page-component-title} with an Ubuntu Desktop system.
Follow these instructions to accomplish the following:

* Download the source code and create a build environment
* A compiled and assembled version from the latest develop branch
* An OpenNMS {page-component-title} core server instance running locally from a development directory

You should be familiar with deploying OpenNMS {page-component-title}, especially setting up package repositories and configuring and initializing the PostgreSQL database.
Basic knowledge of git is highly recommended.

== Before you begin

We publish and maintain the project on GitHub.
Make sure you have access to GitHub to fetch the source with SSH or HTTPS.
Once you have built the software, you need to install packages.
Ensure your user account has administrative permissions with `sudo`.

To build and run {page-component-title} from source, you must install the following components on your system:

* OpenJDK 11 development kit; verify the correct `javac` and `java` executables are in your search path
* xref:deployment:core/getting-started.adoc#install-core-instance[OpenNMS package repositories]
* JICMP and JICMP6 packages to allow sending ICMP messages with Java
* link:https://git-scm.com/[git-scm] to check out the source code from the link:https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms[OpenNMS GitHub repository]
* xref:deployment:core/getting-started.adoc#setup-postgresql[PostgreSQL server] (installed and initialized)
* Perl to run the convenient compile and assemble helper scripts
* Python (some helper scripts require it)
* Docker to run smoke tests or start services as container

Optional packages:

* IPLIKE which is a stored procedure in PostgreSQL for complex IP queries.
  The iplike package is specific to the PostgreSQL major version.
  For example, for PostgreSQL 13.x you need the package `iplike-pgsql13`.
* JRRD2 if you want to use RRDtool instead of the default Java-based RRD implementation JRobin
* RRDtool from the official package repositories

TIP: You can set the environment `JAVA_HOME` in `/etc/environment` if you want additional control about the Java JDK used during builds.
Changes are applied immediately with `source /etc/environment`.

TIP: Within the source tree we ship a Maven version which is used by default.
The environment variable `MVN` allows you to use your own installed Maven version.

== Get the source code

First, you need the source code from the GitHub repository.
The default branch is `develop` which is the release candidate for the major release.
You can check out a specific version tag if you want or switch to a branch you want to build from.
The command `git tag -l` or `git branch -r` gives you available branches or version tags.

.Get the source from GitHub in your home directory
[source, console]
----
git clone https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms.git ~/dev/opennms
cd ~/dev/opennms
----

== Compile and assemble from source

The build is divided into two steps.
The first step compiles the source code and the second step assembles the compiled artefacts so you can run OpenNMS {page-component-title} locally.
To speed up the build steps, we explicitly disable tests and don't create a source tarball file.

.Compile the source code without executing test tasks and skip the source tarball creation
[source, console]
----
./compile.pl -DskipTests
----

.Assemble the build artefacts in the target directory
[source, console]
----
./assemble.pl -p dir -DskipTests
----

The profile argument `-p dir` allows you to run OpenNMS {page-component-title} directly from the target directory.

NOTE: If you build from source the first time, it takes some time.
During the first build, the Maven dependencies download is about ~4GB.
The Maven repository is by default located in the `$\{HOME}/.m2` directory.

== Run your build locally

The following instructions require the release version.
The release version is defined in the root `pom.xml` in the source tree and changes with every major release.
This release version depends on which version tag or branch you have checked out and try to build.
It is helpful to extract the release version in an environment variable and allows you to repeat the following instructions more easily.

TIP: Instead of maintaining a local PostgreSQL installation, you can also run an ephemeral PostgreSQL instance as a container.
     The command `sudo docker run -d -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust -p 5432:5432 postgres:13` starts an instance which allows connections without authentication for development.
     If you want to persist the database on your host for later use, you can add `-v $(pwd)/data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`.

.Set the OpenNMS release version in a global environment variable
[source, console]
----
export ONMS_RELEASE=$(./.circleci/scripts/pom2version.sh pom.xml)
----

.Run the core server instance as your user instead of the opennms system user
[source, console]
----
echo "RUNAS=$(id -u -n)" > "target/opennms-${ONMS_RELEASE}/etc/opennms.conf"
----

The next step is configuring PostgreSQL to initialise the database.
Follow xref:deployment:core/getting-started.adoc#set-up-core-instance[Set up the core instance] from the deployment guide; the procedure is the same.
The configuration file is located in `target/opennms-$\{ONMS_RELEASE}/etc/opennms-datasources.xml`.

.Initialize the Java environment
[source, console]
----
./target/opennms-"${ONMS_RELEASE}"/bin/runjava -s
----

.Initialize the database schema
[source, console]
----
./target/opennms-"${ONMS_RELEASE}"/bin/install -dis
----

.Start the core server instance in background, verbose, and enable remote debugging on port 8001/tcp
[source, console]
----
./target/opennms-"${ONMS_RELEASE}"/bin/opennms -vt start
----

.Stop the core server instance
[source, console]
----
./target/opennms-"${ONMS_RELEASE}"/bin/opennms stop
----
