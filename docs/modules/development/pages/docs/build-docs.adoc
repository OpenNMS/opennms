= Build documentation

This section describes how to build documentation locally. 
We recommend that you do this to test major documentation changes, particularly if adding a lot of new content to the documentation or making significant revisions to existing documentation. 

== Install Antora

Antora is a documenation site generator based around the AsciiDoc format. 
To install Antora, follow the https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.2/install/install-antora/[instructions] on the Antora website.  

== Make a copy of the OpenNMS docs repository

If you already know how to use https://git-scm.com/[git], then this is going to sound very familiar.
If not, hereâ€™s the full walk-through:

. Install git.
. Locate the OpenNMS repo you want to write docs for and https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/[fork] it. (For example, the https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms[core OpenNMS repository].)

. Use git to clone the repo (either the original or your fork, as appropriate) to your local system: `git clone <repo URL>`

If the project that you are working in already has version branches, then you will want to set up local copies of those as well.

After you have cloned the repo to your local system, you can track those branches with the command:

[source, shell]
----
git checkout -b <local_branch_name> <remote_repo>/<remote_branch_name>
----

== Write the docs

The documentation for the project lives in the `docs` directory within the source code repository you have checked out.
Each main section is structured in directories that contain the text `.adoc` files.
Write the text files in the http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc] format.

You need to include every new directory or text file in the general structure of the documentation.
The `nav.adoc` file defines the content hierarchy.

.Sample structure of a nav.adoc file
[source, nav.adoc]
----

.About  <1>
* xref:about:welcome.adoc[Welcome] <2>
* xref:about:legal-notice.adoc[Legal Notice]  <2>

.Installation  <3>
* xref:installation:requirements.adoc[Requirements]  <4>
* xref:installation:rpm.adoc[Installing on RPM-based Linux (CentOS, Fedora, OpenSuse, RedHat)]  <4>
* xref:installation:debian.adoc[Installing on Debian/Ubuntu]  <4>
----
<1> Friendly directory name _About_ that appears in the left navigation.
<2> Each topic in the _About_ section, written as a cross reference to the directory, file name, and friendly name that appears in the left navigation. 
<3> Second section, _Installation_.
<4> Each topic in the _Installation_ section. 

For information on directory structure for images files, see xref:development:docs/images.adoc#doc-guidelines-images[Include images].

== Build the docs

The documentation is located in the `docs` directory.
Transforming an Antora repo into a documentation site is pretty easy:

[source, shell]
----
make docs
----

=== Build Output

Antora creates an archive of the documentation in `build/site.zip` and an extracted one in `public/index.html`, which you can open directly in a browser. 

The generic path to a given version of the docs is:

[source, shell]
----
<docs_repo_dir>/build/site/<distro>/<branch_dir_name>
----
