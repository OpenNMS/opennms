= Include images

Images may be useful to help explain and visualize complex problems.
Nevertheless, minimize the use of screenshots. 
Include screenshots only to illustrate a concept that may be difficult to understand or something that is not easy to locate in the UI.  

Each major component in the documentation (development, deployment, operation) has two folders: `/images` (for graphics) and `/pages` (for text).

The images folder structure mirrors the text structure. 
For example, `/pages/metadata` amd `/images/metatdata`. 
This makes is easier to organize and find images associated with an AsciiDoc text file.

<1> This folder contains all documentation modules.
<2> The modules for the documentation.
<3> Root directory contains `index.adoc` file that Antora uses as the default start page of the component. 
<4> The folder for components within the documentation.
<5> Images folder. 
Images should be *.png or *.jpg if included in the documentation.
<6> Directory to mirror text directory structure.
Images in this diretory are associated with the text in the same directory in the `/pages` folder.  
This folder should also include the editable version of images created from tools like yED.
<7> The image file. 
Use a unique name with no spaces.
<8> Editable version of an image source file.
<9> Pages folder.
Contains .adoc files with text content. 
<10> Folder for a specific documentation topic (equivalent to a chapter).
Text files in this folder may be related. 
<11> AsciiDoc source file.
May include references to images stored in a corresponding folder in the `/images` hierarchy.
<12> Component descriptor file Antora uses to help build the documentation.  


IMPORTANT: All images share the same namespace; therefore, best practice is to use unique identifiers for images.

To include an image file, make sure that it resides in the `images/` directory relative to the document you're including it in.
Then use the following syntax to include it in the document:

.First included image
[source]
----
.This is a caption of the image
image::docs/02_opennms-logo.png[]
----

Which is rendered as:

image::docs/02_opennms-logo.png[logo, 350]


The image path for the images you include is relative to the *.adoc source file where you use the image.
