= Business Service Monitoring

Every aspect of the Business Service Monitoring feature can be controlled via a ReST API.
The API's endpoint for managing business services is located at `/opennms/api/v2/business-services`.
It supports XML content to represent the business services.
The schema file describing the API model is located in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/share/xsds/business-service-dto.xsd`.
The responses generated by the REST API do also include `location` elements that contain references to other entities managed by the API.
The Business Service response data model for the ReST API has the following basic structure:
