=== Installing on RHEL

The following steps will be described:

. Installation of the `opennms` meta package which handles all dependencies
. Initialize _PostgreSQL_ database and configure access
. Initialize _{page-component-title}_ database and start
. Log in to the Web User Interface and change default admin password

You must use _root_ permissions to run all commands on the command line interface.
