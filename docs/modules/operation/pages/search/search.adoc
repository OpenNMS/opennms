= Search

{page-component-title} provides two ways to search in the web UI: through the search bar and the *Search* view.

== Search bar

The search bar uses keywords to return both nodes that match the keyword(s) and a list of actions you can perform that relate to the keyword.
Press the [shift] key twice or click in the search bar to activate it for typing.

Note that the search results for nodes also display any xref:meta-data.adoc#metadata-overview[metadata] associated with the node, such as a label, location, admin user, and so on.

Click on a node to navigate to the node's page.
Click on one of the actions to navigate to the screen that lets you complete the specified action.
For example, clicking on *Edit Requisition 'Test'* takes you to the screen where you can edit the requisition named 'Test'.

== Search view

The Search view provides a number of search options for nodes.
Click *Search* on the main menu to access the *Search* view.

=== Quick search links

Click on the following links to quickly search for the associated information:

* All nodes
* All nodes and their interfaces
* All nodes with asset info

=== Name containing search

Search by name is a case-insensitive, inclusive search.
For example, searching on `serv` finds any of `serv, Service, Reserved, NTSERV, UserVortex`, and so on.
Use the underscore character as a single-character wildcard.
Use the percent character as a multiple-character wildcard.

=== TCP/IP Address like search

Searching by TCP/IP address uses a flexible search format that lets you separate the four or eight (in the case of IPv6) fields of a TCP/IP address into specific searches.
An asterisk (*) in place of any octet matches any value for that octet.
Separate two numbers by a dash (-) to indicate a range.
Use a comma for list demarcation.

For example, the following search fields are all valid and each create the same result set: all TCP/IP addresses from 192.168.0.0 through 192.168.255.255:

* 192.168.\*.*
* 192.168.0-255.0-255
* 192.168.0,1,2,3-255.*
* 2001:6a8:3c80:8000-8fff:*:*:*:*
* fc00,fe80:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

=== System or interface attribute search

A System/Interface attribute search finds nodes with systems or interfaces that match a given search string.
The "contains" modifier provides a case-insensitive, inclusive search similar to the "name containing" search described above.
The "equals" modifier requires the search to find an exact match.

=== Location or Providing service search

Select the location or service to search for from the appropriate drop-down menu.

=== MAC address like search
Case-insensitive, partial string match to find interfaces with hardware (MAC) addresses that match the search string.
For example, to find all interfaces with a specified manufacturer's code, enter the first six characters of the MAC address.
Octet separators (dash or colon) are optional.

=== Foreign Service name like search
Case-insensitive, inclusive search on the foreign service name.
Use the underscore character as a single-character wildcard.
Use the percent character as a multiple-character wildcard.

=== Flows search
Find nodes with or without flows data.

=== Enhanced Linkd topology search

Find nodes with CDP/LLDP data that match the given search string.

=== Category or Field asset information search
Search for nodes that have assets associated with a particular category or field.
The field search includes a list of fields and a text box to match a value.
The field search is case-insensitive and inclusive.
Use the underscore character as a single-character wildcard.
Use the percent character as a multiple-character wildcard.
