= Configuring Collectd

The `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/collectd-configuration.xml` file defines the nodes, services, and parameters on which collectd collects metrics.
It also specifies the list of available collectors.

Edit the `collectd-configuration.xml` file to:

* <<ga-thread-pool-edit, set the thread pool>>
* <<ga-collectd-packages, configure collector packages>>
* specify collectors to use

In addition to editing `collectd-configuration.xml`, you need to <<collectors-configure, configure collectors>> for the protocols from which you want to collect data by editing the configuration files associated with them.

[[ga-thread-pool-edit]]
== Setting the thread pool

A globally defined thread attribute limits the number of threads the data collection process uses in parallel.
Increase or decrease this value based on your network and the size of your server by changing the value in `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/collectd-configuration.xml`:
