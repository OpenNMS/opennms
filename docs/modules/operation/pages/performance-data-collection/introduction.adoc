{page-component-title} collects performance data using the _Collectd_ daemon, which is enabled by default.
_Collectd_ schedules data collection on {page-component-title} entities (currently nodes and interfaces), using _management agents_ and protocol-specific _collectors_ (SNMP, HTTPS, JMX, JDBC, etc.) to collect performance metrics.
Each collector has its own associated configuration that defines parameters for the collector.

By default, data collection is enabled for SNMP and for OpenNMS-JVM (to monitor itself through JMX).
Data collection works out of the box with SNMP, provided you have your SNMP community string configured properly.
The default value of the community string is `public`.
If your community string is different, you need to change the value:

. Login to the web UI.
. Go to *admin>Configure OpenNMS*.
. In the *Provisioning* section, select *Configure SNMP Community Names by IP Address*.
. Under *v1/v2c specific parameters* change the `Read Community String` value and click *Save Config*.

Performance data collection on other protocols (HTTPS, JMX, JDBC, etc.), requires additional configuration.
You may also want to change how _collectd_ works: when, how, and what data it collects.
