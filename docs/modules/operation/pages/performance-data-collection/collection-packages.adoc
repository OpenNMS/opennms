= Collection Packages

To define more complex collection configuration it is possible to group Service configurations that provide performance metrics into collection packages.
This lets you assign different service configurations to nodes to differentiate performance metric collection and connection settings.
To assign a _Collection Package_ to nodes, use the https://wiki.opennms.org/wiki/Filters[Rules/Filters] syntax.

You can configure multiple packages, and an interface can exist in more than one package.
This gives great flexibility in determining the service levels for a given device.
The order how _Collection Packages_ are defined is important when _IP Interfaces_ match multiple _Collection Packages_ with the same _Service_ configuration.
The last _Collection Package_ on the service will be applied.
This can be used to define a less-specific, catch-all filter for a default configuration.
You can use a more specific _Collection Package_ to overwrite the default setting.

----
<1> Unique name of the collection package.
<2> Apply this package to all _IP interfaces_ with a configured _IPv4_ address (not equal `0.0.0.0`)
<3> Evaluate _IPv4 rule_ to collect for all _IPv4 interfaces_ in the given range
<4> Evaluate _IPv6 rule_ to collect for all _IPv6 interfaces_ in the given range

== Service Configurations

Service Configurations define what collector to use and which performance metrics to collect.
Service Configurations contain common Service Attributes as well as Collector-specific parameters.

.Service Configuration Attributes
[source, xml]
----
<service name="SNMP"<1>
         interval="300000"<2>
         user-defined="false"<3>
         status="on"><4>
  <parameter key="collection" value="default"/><5>
  <parameter key="thresholding-enabled" value="true"/><6>
</service>

<collector service="SNMP" class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.collectd.SnmpCollector"/><7>
----
<1> Service configuration name that is mapped to a specific collector implementation.
<2> The interval at which to collect the service. (in milliseconds).
<3> Marker to say if service is user defined, used specifically for UI purposes.
<4> Service is collected only if on.
<5> Assign performance data collection metric groups named `default`.
<6> Enable threshold evaluation for metrics provided by this service.
<7> Run the SnmpCollector implementation for the service named `SNMP`

=== Metadata DSL
The <<meta-data.adoc#ga-meta-data-dsl, Metadata DSL>>(domain specific language) lets you use dynamic configuration in parameter values to interpolate metadata into the parameter. 

The syntax lets you use patterns in an expression, whereby the metadata is replaced with a corresponding value during the collection process.

During evaluation of an expression, the following scopes are available:

* Node metadata
* Interface metadata
* Service metadata
