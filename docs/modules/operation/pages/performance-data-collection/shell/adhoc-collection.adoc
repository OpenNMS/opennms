= Ad hoc collection

The `opennms:collect` Karaf Shell command can be used to trigger and perform a collection on any of the available collectors.

The results of the collection (also referred to as the "collection set") will be displayed in the console after a successful collection.
The resulting collection set will not be persisted, nor will any thresholding be applied.

* List all of the available collectors.

* Invoke the `SnmpCollector` against interface `127.0.0.1` on node `n1` from the `NODES` requisition.
+
[source, karaf]
----
opennms:collect -n NODES:n1 org.opennms.netmgt.collectd.SnmpCollector 127.0.0.1
----

* Invoke the `SnmpCollector` against interface `127.0.0.1` on `NODES:n1` via the `MINION` location.
Setting the location on the command line will override the location set on the node in the database.

----
opennms:collect -l MINION -n NODES:n1 org.opennms.netmgt.collectd.SnmpCollector 127.0.0.1
----
+
NOTE: If you see errors caused by `RequestTimedOutException` when invoking a collector at a remote location, consider increasing the time to live.
By default, `collectd` will use the service interval as the time to live.

* Invoke the `JdbcCollector` against `127.0.0.1` while specifying some of the collector parameters.

----
opennms:collect org.opennms.netmgt.collectd.JdbcCollector 127.0.0.1 collection=PostgreSQL driver=org.postgresql.Driver url=jdbc:postgresql://OPENNMS_JDBC_HOSTNAME/postgres user=postgres
----
+
TIP: Some collectors, such as the `JdbcCollector`, can be invoked without specifying a node.

* Persist a collection.
+
`-p/--persist` option will persist the new collection set by introducing an extra datapoint in addition to data collected during the regular collection intervals.
+

----
opennms:collect -l MINION -n NODES=n1 -p org.opennms.netmgt.collectd.SnmpCollector 127.0.0.1
----
+
NOTE: This option will only persist data to JRB/RRD files if there is an existing file for the defined metrics.
The files should be created on the first successful collection during a regular collection interval.

A complete list of options is available using the help command.

== Interpreting the output

After a successful collection, the collection set will be displayed in the following format:

[source, karaf]
----
resource a
  group 1
    attribute
    attribute
  group 2
    attribute
resource b
  group 1
    attribute
...
----

The description of the resources, groups and attribute may differ between collectors.
This output is independent of the persistence strategy that is being used.
