== Recommendations

You will likely want to change the values of `cache.max_entries` and the `ring_buffer_size` to suit your installation.

{page-component-title} caches metadata related to resources to avoid writing redundant records in Cassandra.
If you are collecting data from a large number of resources, you should increase the cache.max_entries to reflect the number of resources you are collecting from, with a suitable buffer.

The samples the collectors gather are temporarily stored in a ring buffer before they are persisted to Cassandra using Newts.
You should increase the value of the ring_buffer_size if you expect large peaks of collectors returning at once or latency in persisting these to Cassandra.
However, note that the memory the ring buffer uses is reserved, and larger values may require an increased heap size.

Newts uses cache priming to help reduce the number of records that need to be indexed after restarting {page-component-title}.
This works by rebuilding the cache using the index data that has already been persisted in Cassandra.
If you continue to see large spikes of index-related inserts after rebooting, consider increasing the amount of time spent priming the cache.
