= Newts Repository Converter: RRD/JRB to Newts migration utility

Use this utility to migrate existing RRDTool- or JRobin-based data to a Newts cluster.
The migration process traverses the `share/rrd` directory and its subdirectories, reads the data and properties files, and persists this data to Newts.

== Migration

The following suggestions try to minimize the data collection gap that occurs when reconfiguring {page-component-title} for a different storage strategy.
First, we determine the parameters needed for migration of the existing data.
After that, we reconfigure {page-component-title} to persist all new collected data to Newts storage.
Finally, we convert and persist the Rrd- or JRobin-based data to Newts using the newts-repository-converter utility.

=== Prerequisites
 * Working {page-component-title} installation with RRDTool- or JRobin-based storage strategy configured.
 * Installed and working Newts cluster reachable by the {page-component-title} instance.

=== Migration plan

 . Check and write down the values for the following options in your `opennms.properties` file.
   You need this information later to invoke the newts-repository-converter utility.
   .. File `etc/opennms.properties`:
   * In `org.opennms.rrd.storeByGroup`, check if `storeByGroup` is enabled.
   * In `rrd.base.dir`, check for the location where RRD or JRB files are stored.
   * In `rrd.binary`, check for the location of the RRDTool binary.
   .. File `etc/rrd-configuration.properties`:
   * In `org.opennms.rrd.strategyClass`, check if `JRobinRrdStrategy` (JRobin) or `JniRrdStrategy` / `MultithreadedJniRrdStrategy` (RRDTool) is used.
 . Stop your {page-component-title} instance.
 . Reconfigure {page-component-title} to persist data to Newts, so that when correctly configured all new samples will be persisted into Newts after {page-component-title} starts.
   Note that the converter assumes `storeByForeignSource` to be enabled.
 . Start your {page-component-title} instance.
 . Use the newts-repository-converter utility to convert the existing data to Newts by specifying the options that correspond to the information gathered during step #1.

This procedure will minimize the data collection gap to the time needed to reconfigure {page-component-title} for Newts storage.

IMPORTANT: The _newts_converter_ utility needs the path to the base directory of your {page-component-title} instance to read the configuration files.
For example, the utility needs the datasource configuration during the migration process to query the database to look up node data.

== Use
The utility is installed by default and its wrapper script is located in the `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/bin` directory.

[source, shell]
----
$ cd /path/to/opennms/bin
$ ./newts-repository-converter

TIP: When invoked without parameters the usage and help information is printed.

The newts-repository-converter tool provides the following options and parameters:

[options="header, %autowidth"]
|===
| Short-option | Long-option | Description | Default
| `h` | `help`           | Prints help and usage. information                                                      | false
| `o` | `onms-home`      | {page-component-title} home directory                                                | /opt/opennms
| `r` | `rrd-dir`        | The path to the RRD data                                                               | ONMS-HOME/share/rrd
| `t` | `rrd-tool`       | Whether to use RRDtool or JRobin.                                                       |
| `T` | `rrd-binary`     | The binary path to the rrdtool command (used only if rrd-tool is set).                  | /usr/bin/rrdtool
| `s` | `store-by-group` | Whether store by group was enabled.                                              |
| `n` | `threads`        | Number of conversion threads                                                           | defaults to number of CPUs

== Example 1: Convert RRD-based data with storeByGroup enabled

The following example shows how to convert RRDTool-based data that was stored with `storeByGroup` enabled.
The {page-component-title} home is `/opt/opennms`, the data directory is `/opt/opennms/share/rrd`, and the RRDTool binary located at `/usr/local/bin/rrdtool`.
This program call uses 16 concurrent threads to convert the RRD files.

[source, shell]
----
$ ./newts-repository-converter -t true -s true -T /usr/local/bin/rrdtool -n 16
<output omitted>
----

== Example 2: Convert JRobin-based data with storeByGroup disabled

The following example shows how to convert JRobin-based data located in the directory `/mnt/opennms/rrd` that was collected with `storeByGroup` disabled.
This program call uses eight concurrent threads to convert the JRB files.

[source, shell]
----
$ ./newts-repository-converter -t false -s false -r /mnt/opennms/rrd -n 8
<output omitted>
