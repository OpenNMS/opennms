= Daemon Configuration Files

Configuration changes can require a restart of OpenNMS and some daemons are able to reload configuration changes by a running CLI command or by sending a daemon reload event.

NOTE: Check out the daemon reference section (LINK MISSING) to get an overview about all daemons and the related configuration files and which can be reloaded without restarting OpenNMS.

== Reload daemons by CLI

To use the reload commands in the CLI, log into the Karaf Shell on your system using:

[source, console]
----
ssh -p 8101 admin@localhost
----

To reload a daemon use the `reload-daemon` command:
[source, console]
----
admin@opennms()> reload-daemon NAME
----

NOTE: A list of reloadable daemons can be obtained by pressing `tabulator` after the command.

== Reload daemons by reload event

.Running reload command in a shell
[source, console]
----
cd $\{OPENNMS_HOME}/bin
./send-event.pl uei.opennms.org/internal/reloadDaemonConfig --parm 'daemonName NAME'
----

.Running the reload command in Docker
[source, shell]
----
docker exec -it horizon /opt/opennms/bin/send-event.pl  uei.opennms.org/internal/reloadDaemonConfig --parm 'daemonName NAME'
----

== Check daemon reload results

A daemon reload generates the events `uei.opennms.org/internal/reloadDaemonConfig` as an indicator that the reload process was triggered, a positive feedback with event `uei.opennms.org/internal/reloadDaemonConfigSuccessful` or a negative feedback with event `uei.opennms.org/internal/reloadDaemonConfigFailed` when OpenNMS was not able to load it accordingly. In this case also an event reason will be noticed in the event description.
