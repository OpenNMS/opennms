= Timeseries Integration Layer

This section describes how to configure {page-component-title} to use the Time Series Integration Layer.

Traditionally {page-component-title} supports storing time series data in RRD files on disk or via Newts in Cassandra.
These implementations require a deep knowledge of OpenNMS. It is hard to add another time series database.

With the rise of many new time series databases, we want to provide an easy way to support other time series databases with minimal effort.
This lead to the development of the Time Series Integration Layer.

The  Time Series Integration Layer lets users integrate a new time series database via OSGi plugin.

Examples of time series plugins:
