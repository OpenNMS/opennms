= Event Troubleshooting

== Debugging

When debugging events, it may be helpful to lower the minimum severity at which eventd will log from the default level of `WARN`.
To change this setting, edit `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/log4j2.xml` and locate the following line:

[source,xml]
----
<KeyValuePair key="eventd" value="WARN" />
----

Changes to `log42.xml` will take effect within 60 seconds with no further action needed.
At the `DEBUG` level, eventd will log a verbose description of every event it handles to `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/logs/eventd.log`.
On busy systems, this setting may create so much noise as to be impractical.
In these cases, you can get terse event summaries by setting eventd to log at level `INFO` and setting `logEventSummaries="yes"` in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/eventd-configuration.xml`.

[[send-event]]
== Manually send events

You can manually create and send an event to trigger processes inside of {page-component-title} through the UI or using the <<event-utility, send-event.pl utility>>.
In most cases, you would do this to reload daemon configuration without having to restart {page-component-title}.

[[send-event-ui]]
To manually send an event in the UI, follow these steps:

. In {page-component-title} click the menu:Gears Icon[Event Management > Manually Send an Event].
. Select the event from the *Event* list.
. Specify additional information, including the UUID, Node ID, parameters, severity, and so on, and click *Send Event*.
. Choose menu:Status[Events] to view the event.

[[event-utility]]
=== send-event.pl utility

In addition to manually adding events, you can also use the send-event.pl utility as an automation tool to trigger events as part of continuous integration scripts or other automated processes.

For example:

* Create a new suspect event every time you add a new resource.
* Clear out alarms.
* Open a ticket in your integrated ticketing system.
* Send a notification reminder to order new ink cartridges when your printer is out of toner.

Format: `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/bin/send-event.pl <uei> [host:port] [options]`

The `host:port` defines the hostname and port to send the event; by default, it points to the local host.

Find UEIs and their associated parameters in the `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/eventd-configuration.xml` file.
See also xref:events/event-configuration.adoc#ga-events-event-configuration[Event daemon configuration].

.`send-event.pl` parameters
[options="header"]
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Name/Alias
| Description

2+|*Required*

| uei
| The unique event identifier (UEI) indicates the type of event.
View UEIs in the eventd-configuration.xml file.
You can also define your own UEIs.

2+|*Optional*

| -d (--description)
| A description for the event browser.

| -f (--ifindex)
| ifIndex of the associated service.

| -h (--help)
| Help message for the script.
(The content from this table.)

| -i (--interface)
| IP address of associated interface.

| -l (--logmsg)
| A short log message for the event browser (secure field by default).

| -n (--nodeid)
| Database ID of associated node (or use foreignSource, foreignId parameters).

| -p (-parameter)
| Parameter in key=value form.
For example, `-p 'url \http://www.opennms.com/'`

| -s (--service)
| Name of the associated service.

| -x (--severity)
| Severity of the event: +
1=Indeterminate +
2=Cleared +
3=Normal +
4=Warning +
5=Minor +
6=Major +
7=Critical +

| -t (--timezone)
| The time zone you are in.

| -v (--verbose)
| Print raw XML that is generated.

| -V (--version)
| Print version and exit successfully.
|===

Note that parameter descriptions use the percentage sign (%) as a delimiter to mark a replacement variable (see xref:events/event-tokens.adoc#replacement-tokens[Replacement tokens]).
If a literal % sign appears in your description, you must escape it with a %.
For example,

`'testUrl \https://www.opennms.org/ReportSection?filter=FOO_BAR_BAZ%%20eq%%20%%27101%%27'`

=== Example

Send an event to reload the eventd configuration.

[source, console]
----
$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/bin/send-event.pl -p 'daemonName Eventd' uei.opennms.org/internal/reloadDaemonConfig
----

== Karaf Shell

Use the `opennms:show-event-config` command to render the event definition for one or more event UEIs (matching a substring) to XML.
This command is useful for displaying event definitions that may not be easily accessible on disk, or verifying that particular events were actually loaded.

[source, karaf]
----
opennms:show-event-config -u uei.opennms.org/alarms
