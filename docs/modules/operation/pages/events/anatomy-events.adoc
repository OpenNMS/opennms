    A short, static label summarizing the gist of all instances of this event.
Description::
    A long-form description of all instances of this event.
Log Message::
    A long-form log message describing this event, optionally including expansions of fields and parameters so that the value is tailored to the event at hand.

    A severity for this event type.
    Possible values range from `Cleared` to `Critical`.
Event ID::
    A numeric identifier used to look up a specific event in the {page-component-title} system.
