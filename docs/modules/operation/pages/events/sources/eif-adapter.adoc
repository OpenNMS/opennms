= IBM Tivoli Event Integration Facility

You can configure {page-component-title} to receive events sent using the https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/netcoolomnibus/8.1?topic=reference-overview-tivoli-event-integration-facility[Tivoli Event Integration Facility].
These EIF events are translated into {page-component-title} events using preconfigured rules.
The resulting UEIs are anchored in the `uei.opennms.org/vendor/IBM/EIF/` namespace, with the name of the EIF event class appended.

A sample event configuration for the `OMEGAMON_BASE` class is included with OpenNMS.

== Configuring the EIF Adapter

Once {page-component-title} starts and the Karaf shell is accessible, you can install the EIF Adapter feature and configure it to listen on a specific interface and port.

NOTE: By default the EIF Adapter listens on TCP port 1828 on all interfaces.

.OSGi login, installation, and configuration of the EIF Adapter
[source]
----
[root@localhost /root]# $ ssh -p 8101 admin@localhost
...
opennms> feature:install eif-adapter
opennms> config:edit org.opennms.features.eifadapter
opennms> config:property-set interface 0.0.0.0
opennms> config:property-set port 1828
opennms> config:update
----

To ensure that the feature continues to be installed on subsequent restarts, add `eif-adapter` to a file in `featuresBoot.d`:
[source, console]
----
echo "eif-adapter" | sudo tee ${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/featuresBoot.d/eif-adapter.boot
----

You can check the routes status with the `camel:*` commands and inspect the log with `log:tail` for any obvious errors.

NOTE: link:$$http://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest/#_using_the_console$$[Documentation] on using the OSGi console embedded in OpenNMS and the related https://camel.apache.org/camel-karaf/latest/index.html[camel commands].

You should now be able to configure your EIF forwarders to send to this destination, and their events will be translated into {page-component-title} events and written to the event bus.

[[ga-events-sources-eif-troubleshooting]]
== Troubleshooting

If events are not reaching {page-component-title}, check whether the event source (EIF forwarder) is correctly configured.
In particular, review the `HOSTNAME` and `PORT` parameters of the event destination configuration.
Also check that your situations are configured to forward to the EIF destination.

If those appear to be correct, verify that the EIF forwarder can communicate with {page-component-title} over the configured port (default 1828).

Review the OSGi log with `log:tail` or the `camel:*` commands.
