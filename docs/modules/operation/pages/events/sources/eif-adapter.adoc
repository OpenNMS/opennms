= Receiving IBM Tivoli Event Integration Facility Events

You can configure {page-component-title} to receive events sent using the #https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSHTQ_8.1.0/com.ibm.netcool_OMNIbus.doc_8.1.0/omnibus/wip/eifsdk/reference/omn_eif_eifreference.html[Tivoli Event Integration Facility].#
These EIF events are translated into OpenNMS events using preconfigured rules. 
The resulting UEI are anchored in the `uei.opennms.org/vendor/IBM/EIF/` namespace, with the name of the EIF https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSHTQ_8.1.0/com.ibm.netcool_OMNIbus.doc_8.1.0/omnibus/wip/eifsdk/concept/ecoemst16.html[event class] appended.

A sample event configuration for the `OMEGAMON_BASE` class is included with OpenNMS.

== Configuring the EIF Adapter

Once {page-component-title} starts and the Karaf shell is accessible, you can install the EIF Adapter feature and configure it to listen on a specific interface and port.

NOTE: By default the EIF Adapter listens on TCP port 1828 on all interfaces.

.OSGi login, installation, and configuration of the EIF Adapter
[source]
----
[root@localhost /root]# $ ssh -p 8101 admin@localhost
...
opennms> feature:install eif-adapter
opennms> config:edit org.opennms.features.eifadapter
opennms> config:property-set interface 0.0.0.0
opennms> config:property-set port 1828
opennms> config:update
----

You can check the routes status with the `camel:*` commands and/or inspect the log with `log:tail` for any obvious errors.
The feature has a debug level logging that can be used to debug operations.

NOTE: link:$$http://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest/#_using_the_console$$[Documentation] on using the OSGi console embedded in OpenNMS and the related #https://camel.apache.org/camel-karaf/latest/index.html[camel commands]#.

NOTE: Features installed through the Karaf shell persist only as long as the `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/data` directory remains intact. 
To enable the feature permanently, add it to the `featuresBoot` list in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/org.apache.karaf.features.cfg`.

You should now be able to configure your EIF forwarders to send to this destination, and their events will be translated into OpenNMS events and written to the event bus.

[[ga-events-sources-eif-troubleshooting]]
== Troubleshooting

If events are not reaching OpenNMS, check whether the event source (EIF forwarder) is correctly configured.
Check your event destination configuration. In particular review the `HOSTNAME` and `PORT` parameters. Also check that your situations are configured to forward to that EIF destination.

If those appear to be correct verify that the EIF forwarder can communicate with OpenNMS over the configured port (default 1828).

Review the OSGi log with `log:tail` or the `camel:*` commands.
