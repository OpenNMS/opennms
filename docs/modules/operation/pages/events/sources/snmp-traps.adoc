= SNMP Traps

If SNMP-capable devices in the network are configured to send *traps* to {page-component-title}, these traps are transformed into events according to pre-configured rules.
The `Trapd` service daemon, which lets {page-component-title} receive SNMP traps, is enabled by default.

IMPORTANT: Disabling the `Trapd` service daemon will render {page-component-title} *incapable* of receiving SNMP traps.

Event definitions are included with {page-component-title} for traps from many vendors' equipment.

== Traps Forwarded via Proxy

When SNMP traps are forwarded through a proxy using SNMPv2c or SNMPv3, preserving the original source IP address is a challenge due to the lack of an `agent-addr` field in the `TRAP-V2` PDU used in those protocol versions.
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3584#page-42[RFC 3584] defines an optional varbind `snmpTrapAddress (.1.3.6.1.6.3.18.1.3.0)` that can be added to forwarded traps to convey the original source IP address.

To configure {page-component-title} to honor `snmpTrapAddress` when present, set `use-address-from-varbind="true"` in the top-level element of `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/trapd-configuration.xml` and restart {page-component-title}.

----
<1> Set the SNMP trap daemon listening port to 1162/udp
<2> Don't create new nodes when receiving a SNMP Trap with an uknown source IP address
<3> Try using the identifier source IP address from the `snmpTrapAddress` varbind instead of the UDP source IP address
