= Kafka Consumer (Events)

You can also create events by routing them to a specific topic on Kafka.
The Kafka Consumer feature allows events to be consumed from a specific topic on Kafka.

Create events in protobuf format: link:https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/[Google Protocol Buffers (GPB)].
See `kafka-consumer-events.proto` for the model definitions.

The Kafka Consumer by default consumes events from the topic configured and forwards them to eventd.

== Enable Kafka Consumer

The Kafka Consumer is disabled by default and can be enabled as follows.

First, log in to the Karaf shell of your {page-component-title} instance and configure the Kafka client settings to point to your Kafka broker.
See link:https://kafka.apache.org/27/documentation.html#consumerconfigs[Consumer Configs] for a complete list of available options.

.Configure features and Kafka client via Karaf shell
[source, console]
----
ssh -p 8101 admin@localhost
----

.Configure Kafka for Event Consumer
[source, karaf]
----
config:edit org.opennms.features.kafka.consumer.client
config:property-set bootstrap.servers my-kafka-ip-1:9092,my-kafka-ip-2:9092<1>
config:update
----

<1> Connect to the following Kafka nodes and adjust the IPs or FQDNs with the Kafka port (9092) accordingly.

Next, install the `opennms-kafka-consumer` feature from that same shell:

.Install Kafka Consumer feature
[source, karaf]
----
feature:install opennms-kafka-consumer
----

To ensure that the feature continues to be installed on subsequent restarts, add `opennms-kafka-consumer` to a file in `featuresBoot.d`:
[source, console]
----
echo "opennms-kafka-consumer" | sudo tee ${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/featuresBoot.d/kafka-consumer.boot
----

== Configure topic name

.Karaf login, configuration of events topic
[source, console]
----
ssh -p 8101 admin@localhost
----

[source, karaf]
----
config:edit org.opennms.features.kafka.consumer
config:property-set eventsTopic opennms-kafka-events
config:update
----

NOTE: While configuring the eventsTopic, make sure that it doesn't conflict with other topics in the {page-component-title} subsystem.
If you are unsure, keep the default one.
