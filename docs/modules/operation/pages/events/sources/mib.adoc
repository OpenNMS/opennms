= Event Definitions and Management Information Base (MIB) Files

Management Information Base (MIB) files are text files written in Abstact Syntax Notation.
They describe Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) elements for specific devices.
By default, {page-component-title} includes an extensive list of MIB definitions from a number of vendors.
You will need to import MIB files for unformatted events as part of configuring SNMP traps.

You can parse SNMP MIB definitions and create OpenNMS event definitions from any `TRAP-TYPE` and/or `NOTIFICATION-TYPE` macros they contain through the UI.

Two command-line utilities, `mib2events` and `mib2opennms`, are also available to help make event definitions from MIB definitions.
The UI editor does at least as good a job as `mib2events`.
We do not recommend using using `mib2opennms`, as it produces more bus errors than event definitions.

To import a MIB file and create event definitions, follow these steps:

. Save the vendor MIB file to your local drive or USB stick.
. In {page-component-title} click the gears icon and select *Additional Tools>SNMP MIB Compiler*.
. Click *Upload MIB*.
. Select the MIB file and click *Open*.
. Right-click the file and choose *Compile MIB*.
. If the log area displays an error (usually a missing dependency), you need to correct the error to compile the MIB file successfully.
.. Determine the type of error (dependency, file syntax).
.. Google the name of the missing content, save it as a text file, upload it, and compile again.

.. Right-click the file and choose *Edit MIB*.
.. Edit the file to address the error, click *Save* and run the compile again.
. Continue to edit the file until it compiles successfully.
. Right-click on the MIB from which you want to generate an event and choose *Generate Events*.
. If desired, modify the name of the UEI base with the vendor name for easier troubleshooting and click *Configure*.
+
. Click *Save Events File* to save them to the event.conf file.

If you were getting unformatted events, you will now get formatted ones.
