= System Properties

The global behavior of {page-component-title} is configured with properties files.
Configuration can also affect the Java virtual machine under which {page-component-title} runs.
Changes in these properties files require a restart of {page-component-title}.
The configuration files can be found in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc`.

The priority for Java system properties is as follows:

. Those set via the _Java_ command line i.e., in `opennms.conf` via `ADDITIONAL_MANAGER_OPTIONS`
. `opennms.properties.d/*.properties`
. `opennms.properties`
. `libraries.properties`
. `rrd-configuration.properties`
. `bootstrap.properties`

Property files in `opennms.properties.d/` are sorted alphabetically.

TIP: To avoid conflicts with customized configurations, all custom properties can be added to one or more files in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/opennms.properties.d/`.
     We recommend to not modify default OpenNMS properties.
     Create dedicated files with your customized properties in `opennms.properties.d/`.
