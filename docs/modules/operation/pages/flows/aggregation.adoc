= Aggregation

The flow query engine supports rendering Top-N metrics from pre-aggregated documents stored in Elasticsearch.
Use these to help alleviate compute load on the Elasticsearch cluster, particularly for environments with large volumes of flows (>10,000 flows/sec).

To use this functionality you must enable the Kafka forwarder as described in <<flows/setup.adoc#kafka-forwarder-config, Configure Kafka forwarder>> and set up link:https://github.com/OpenNMS/nephron[Nephron] to process the flows.

NOTE: Nephron currently requires an link:https://flink.apache.org/[Apache Flink] cluster to deploy the job.

YOu can set the following properties in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME/etc/org.opennms.features.flows.persistence.elastic.cfg` to control the query engine to use aggregated flows:

[options="header, %autowidth"]
|===
| Property | Description | Required | Default

| `alwaysUseRawForQueries`
| Set to `true` to use raw flow documents to respond to all queries and effectively disable the use of aggregated flows.
| `false`
| `true`

| `alwaysUseAggForQueries`
| Set to `true` to use raw aggregated flow documents to respond to all queries and effectively disable the use of raw flows.
| `false`
| `false` 

| `timeRangeDurationAggregateThresholdMs`
| Queries with time range filters that have a duration greater than this value will use aggregated flows when possible.
| `false`
| `120000` (2 minutes)

| `timeRangeEndpointAggregateThresholdMs`
| Queries with time range filters that have an endpoint that is older than this value will use aggregated flows when possible.
| `false`
| `604800000` (7 days)
