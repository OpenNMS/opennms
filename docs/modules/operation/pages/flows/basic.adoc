= Basic Flows Setup

This section describes how to get started with flows to collect, enrich (classify), persist, and visualize flows.

== Requirements

Make sure you have the following before you set up flows:

* OpenNMS up and running.
* Device(s) that sends flows visible to OpenNMS and monitored with SNMP.
* Elasticsearch cluster set up with the link:https://github.com/OpenNMS/elasticsearch-drift-plugin[Elasticsearch Drift plugin] installed on every Elasticsearch node.
** The Drift plugin persists and queries flows that {page-component-title} collects.
The Drift version must match the targeted Elasticsearch version.
** (optional) Configure Elasticsearch variables like `search.max_buckets` or maximum heap size `ES-JAVA_OPTS`if the default values are not sufficient for your volume of flows or number of nodes.
** (optional) Create a job to clean the indices so that the disk does not fill up; for example, keep X days of flows.
Filled disks are a challenging problem to address for non-Elasticsearch experts.
We recommend the Elasticsearch link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/current/index.html[Curator tool] to do this.
** Monitor the Elasticsearch stack in OpenNMS to get an alarm if it goes down.
* Set up OpenNMS Helm with Grafana to visualize flows.
** Configure the flow and performance data sources.

== Configure OpenNMS to communicate with Elasticsearch

OpenNMS needs to talk to Elasticsearch and know where to store the flows data it collects (persistence).

From a Karaf shell on your {page-component-title} instance, update `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/org.opennms.features.flows.persistence.elastic.cfg` to configure the flow persistence to use your Elasticsearch cluster:

.Connect to Karaf shell
[source, console]
----
ssh -p 8101 admin@localhost
----

.Configure Elasticsearch settings within Karaf
[source, karaf]
----
config:edit org.opennms.features.flows.persistence.elastic
config:property-set elasticUrl http://elastic:9200
config:update
----

We also recommend setting the following:

.Edit (or create) `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/org.opennms.features.flows.persistence.elastic.cfg`
[source, xml]
----
# ElasticSearch persistence configuration
elasticUrl = http://10.10.3.218:9200 <1>
connTimeout = 30000
readTimeout = 300000
settings.index.number_of_replicas = 0
settings.index.number_of_shards=1
settings.index.refresh_interval=10s
elasticIndexStrategy=daily
----
<1> Replace with comma-separated list of Elasticsearch nodes.

See <<elasticsearch/introduction.adoc#ga-elasticsearch-integration-configuration, General Elasticsearch Configuration>> for a complete set of options.

== Enable protocols

Update `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/telemetryd-configuration.xml` to enable one or more of the protocols you want to handle.

This example enables the NetFlow v5 protocol.
Use the same process for any of the other flow-related protocols.

[source, xml]
----
<listener name="Netflow-5-UDP-8877" class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.telemetry.listeners.UdpListener" enabled="true">
    <parameter key="port" value="8877"/>

    <parser name="Netflow-5-Parser" class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.telemetry.protocols.netflow.parser.Netflow5UdpParser" queue="Netflow-5" />
</listener>

<queue name="Netflow-5">
    <adapter name="Netflow-5-Adapter" class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.telemetry.protocols.netflow.adapter.netflow5.Netflow5Adapter" enabled="true">
    </adapter>
</queue>
----

Send a `reloadDaemonConfig` event via the CLI to apply the changes without restarting:

[source, console]
----
${OPENNMS_HOME}/bin/send-event.pl -p 'daemonName Telemetryd' uei.opennms.org/internal/reloadDaemonConfig
----

This opens a UDP socket bound to `0.0.0.0:8877` to which NetFlow v5 messages are forwarded.
(See also xref:operation:admin/daemon-config-files.adoc#daemon-reload[Reload daemons by CLI].)

=== Multi-port listener

If you are monitoring multiple flow protocols, you normally need to set up a flow listener for each one, on its own UDP port.

By default, {page-component-title} enables a multi-port listener option, which monitors multiple protocols on a single UDP port (9999).
If desired, edit `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/telemetryd-configuration.xml` to change the port number or add/remove protocols.

IMPORTANT: Make sure any ports you configure for receiving flow data are added to your firewall allow list.

== Enable flows on your device(s)

Configure your devices to send flows.
Refer to the manufacturer's documentation.
You may need to set up the flow receiver, which is OpenNMS {page-component-title}, and enable sending flows per interface on the firewall.

== Link the web UI to Helm

To access flow-related graphs from the {page-component-title} web interface, you must configure a link to your instance of OpenNMS Helm.

.Connect to Karaf shell
[source, console]
----
ssh -p 8101 admin@localhost
----

.Configure Helm settings within Karaf
[source, karaf]
----
config:edit org.opennms.netmgt.flows.rest
config:property-set flowGraphUrl 'http://grafana:3000/dashboard/flows?node=$nodeId&interface=$ifIndex'
config:update
----

NOTE: This URL can optionally point to other tools as well.
It supports placeholders for `$nodeId`, `$ifIndex`, `$start`, and `$end`.

Once configured, an icon appears on the top-right corner of a resource graph for an SNMP interface if there is flow data for that interface.

You have completed a basic flows set up.
If you have issues, refer to the troubleshooting flows section.

== Beyond basic flows setup

You may want to do the following:

* Classify data flows
** OpenNMS resolves flows to application names.
Create rules to override the default classifications, to customize for your preference.
See xref:flows/classification-engine.adoc#ga-flow-support-classification-engine[Application Classification].

* xref:operation:flows/distributed.adoc#flows-remote[Enable remote flows data collection]
* xref:operation:flows/sentinel/sentinel.adoc#flows-scaling[Scale to manage large volumes of flows data]
