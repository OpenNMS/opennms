= Flows

Flows refers to the summary of network traffic sent by network devices (switches, routers, and so on).
This information includes, but is not limited to, source and destination address, source and destination port, octet count, and duration of activity.
Collecting and analyzing flows data provides a picture of network usage and helps to diagnose network issues.
Persisting flows for long-term storage can aid in forensic analysis.

{page-component-title} provides the following:

* A platform to collect, persist, and visualize flows, with support for NetFlow versions 5 and 9, IPFIX, and sFlow
* Inventory enrichment (mapping to OpenNMS nodes)
* Application classification
* Horizontal scaling
* Enterprise reporting (generate PDF reports)
* Top K statistics by interface, application, host, conversation with QoS

See the <<reference:telemetryd/protocols/introduction.adoc#ref-protocol, Telemetry>> section for a list of supported protocols.

This section presents a set of procedures to set up flows that progress from a basic environment to more complex:

* xref:operation:flows/basic.adoc#flows-basic[Basic setup] (out-of-the-box)
* Flows data in a distributed/remote network (add a Minion)
* Processing large volume of flows data (add Sentinel to scale)
* Issues with flows at scale and queries taking too long (add Nephron for aggregation and streaming analytics)

== How it works

At a high level, with a xref:operation:flows/basic.adoc#flows-basic[basic setup], OpenNMS processes flows as follows:

* <<telemetryd/introduction.adoc#ga-telemetryd, Telemetryd>> receives and decodes flows on {page-component-title}.
* Telemetryd adapters convert the flows to a canonical flow model.
* Flows are enriched:
** The <<flows/classification-engine.adoc#ga-flow-support-classification-engine, classification engine>> tags flows with an application name.
** Metadata related to associated nodes (such as IDs and categories) are also added to the flows.
* Enriched flows are persisted in Elasticsearch and/or forwarded to Kafka.
* You can use <<flows/nephron.adoc#ga-nephron, Nephron>> to aggregate flows and output aggregates to Elasticsearch, Cortex, or Kafka.
* The REST API supports generating both summaries and time series data from the flows or flow aggregates stored in Elasticsearch.
* Use OpenNMS Helm to visualize flows and/or flow aggregates:
** Use the "Flow Deep Dive" dashboard to visualize flows and flow aggregates that are stored in Elasticsearch using the flow datasource that interfaces with the {page-component-title} REST API.
** Use the "Cortex Flow Deep Dive" dashboard that uses a Prometheus datasource to access flow aggregates stored in Cortex.
