= Flow Support

{page-component-title} supports receiving, decoding, and persisting flow information sent from your network devices.
A list of currently supported protocols is available in the <<reference:telemetryd/protocols/introduction.adoc#ref-protocol, Telemetry>> section.
While flows offer a great breadth of information, the current focus of the support in {page-component-title} is aimed at:

* Network diagnostic: viewing the top protocols and top talkers within the context of a particular network interface.
* Forensic analysis: persisting the flows for long-term storage.

== How it works

At a high level:

* <<telemetryd/introduction.adoc#ga-telemetryd, Telemetryd>> receives and decodes flows on both {page-component-title} and Minion.
* Telemetryd adapters convert the flows to a canonical flow model.
* Flows are enriched:
** Flows are tagged with an application name via the <<flows/classification-engine.adoc#ga-flow-support-classification-engine, classification engine>>.
** Metadata related to associated nodes (such as IDs and categories) are also added to the flows.
* Enriched flows are persisted in Elasticsearch and/or forwarded to Kafka.
* You can use <<flows/nephron.adoc#ga-nephron, Nephron>> to aggregate flows and output aggregates to Elasticsearch, Cortex, or Kafka.
* The REST API supports generating both summaries and time series data from the flows or flow aggregates stored in Elasticsearch.
* Use OpenNMS Helm to visualize flows and/or flow aggregates:
** Use the "Flow Deep Dive" dashboard to visualize flows and flow aggregates that are stored in Elasticsearch using the flow datasource that interfaces with the {page-component-title} REST API.
** Use the "Cortex Flow Deep Dive" dashboard that uses a Prometheus datasource to access flow aggregates stored in Cortex.
