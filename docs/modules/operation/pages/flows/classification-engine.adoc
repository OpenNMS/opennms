= Classification Engine

The Classification Engine applies a set of user- and/or system-defined rules to each flow to classify it.
This lets users group flows by applications, for example, if all flows to port 80 are marked as `http`.

To classify a flow, you must define a rule.
A rule defines at least a name, which the flow is classified with, and additional parameters that must match for a successful classification.

== Rule definition
A rule has the following fields:

|===
| Name | Mandatory | Description

| `group`
| `mandatory`
| The group in which this rule was placed, e.g., `system-defined`, see also <<rule-groups,Rule Groups>>

| `position`
| `mandatory`
| The position at which it is placed within its group, relevant for the <<evaluation-order, order of evaluation>>.

| `name`
| `mandatory`
| The name the flow is classified with, e.g., `http`.

| `dstPort`
| `optional`
| The `dstPort` of the flow must match this port.
  May be a range or list of ports, e.g., 80,8080,8980, or 8000-9000.

| `dstAddress`
| `optional`
| The `dstAddress` of the flow must match this address.
  May contain wildcards.

| `srcPort`
| `optional`
| The `srcPort` of the flow must match this port.
  See `dstPort` for more details.

| `srcAddress`
| `optional`
| The `srcAddress` of the flow must match this address.
  See `dstAddress` for more details.

| `exporterFilter`
| `optional`
| The exporter of the flow must match this criteria.
  It supports all capabilities of the https://wiki.opennms.org/wiki/Filters[{page-component-title} Filters API].

| `protocol`
| `optional`
| The IP protocol of the flow must match this criteria.
|===

Even if all fields (besides `group`, `position`, and `name`) are optional, at least one of them must be defined to be considered a valid rule.

A list of predefined rules already exist in the group `pre-defined`.
The predefined rules are inspired by the https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml[IANA Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry].
Define new rules using the Classification UI, under the gears icon in the web UI: *Flow Management -> Manage Flow Classification*

== Omnidirectional Rules
You can mark rules as omnidirectional, which additionally evaluates the rules with interchanged endpoint addresses and ports.
This is helpful if traffic related to a matching classification should be classified the same way.

[[rule-groups]]
== Rule Groups
Rules live within a rule group.
New groups can be added, edited, and deleted via the Classification UI.
The `pre-defined` group is read only. You cannot alter it or its rules.

[[evaluation-order]]
== Order of Evaluation
Rules and groups have a position.
Lower positions are evaluated first.
The position of a rules group is more important than the rule's position within its group. The system-defined group is always evaluated last.

An example of an evaluation:

|===
| Group Position | Group     | Rule Position | Rule
| `1`            | `group 1` | `1`           | `rule 1.1`
| `1`            | `group 1` | `2`           | `rule 1.2`
| `1`            | `group 1` | `3`           | `rule 1.3`
| `1`            | `group 1` | `4`           | `rule 1.4`
| `2`            | `group 2` | `1`           | `rule 2.1`
| `2`            | `group 2` | `2`           | `rule 2.2`
| `2`            | `group 2` | `3`           | `rule 2.3`
| `2`            | `group 2` | `4`           | `rule 2.4`
| `3`            | `group 3` | `1`           | `rule 3.1`
| `3`            | `group 3` | `2`           | `rule 3.2`
|===

Change the positions of rules and groups by drag and drop or by editing the position field in the edit dialogs.

== Verification

With a more complex set of rules, it is not always easy to verify if everything is configured correctly.
To make things easier, the Classification UI lets you test/verify a classification.
To do so, navigate to the Classification UI:
*Gear icon-> Flow Management -> Manage Flow Classification* and select the Test classification icon in the top right.
This simulates sending a flow to the Classification Engine with certain fields.

== Example

Let's assume the following rules are defined:

|===
| name |  srcAddress | srcPort | dstAddress | dstPort | protocol | exporterFilter

| `OpenNMS`
|
|
| 10.0.0.1
| 8980
| tcp,udp
|

| `http`
|
|
|
| 80,8980,8080,9000
| udp,tcp
|

| `https`
|
|
|
| 443
|
|

| `Exporters`
|
|
|
|
|
| categoryName == 'Exporters'
|===


The following flows are sent to {page-component-title} and with the rules defined above classified accordingly.
