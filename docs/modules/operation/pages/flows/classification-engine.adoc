= Classification Engine

The Classification Engine applies a set of user- and/or system-defined rules to each flow to classify it.
This lets users group flows by applications, for example, if all flows to port 80 are marked as `http`.

To classify a flow, you must define a rule.
A rule defines at least a name, which the flow is classified with, and additional parameters that must match for a successful classification.

== Rule definition
A rule has the following fields:

[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Name            | Description
2+| *Required*

| group
| The group in which this rule was placed.
See also <<rule-groups,Rule Groups>>.

| position
| The position at which it is placed within its group, relevant for the <<evaluation-order, order of evaluation>>.

| name
| The name the flow is classified with; for example, `http`.

2+| *Optional*

| dstPort
| The destination port of the flow to match.
May be a range or list of ports; for example, 80,8080,8980, or 8000-9000.

| dstAddress
| The destination IP address of the flow to match.
May contain wildcards.

| srcPort
| The source port of the flow to match.
See `dstPort` for more details.

| srcAddress
| The source IP address of the flow to match.
See `dstAddress` for more details.

| exporterFilter
| The exporter of the flow must match this criteria.
This parameter supports all capabilities of the https://wiki.opennms.org/wiki/Filters[{page-component-title} Filters API].

| protocol
| The IP protocol of the flow to match.
|===

Even if all fields (besides `group`, `position`, and `name`) are optional, at least one of them must be defined to be considered a valid rule.

A list of predefined rules already exist in the group `pre-defined`.
The predefined rules are inspired by the https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml[IANA Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry].
Define new rules using the Classification UI, under the gears icon in the web UI: menu:Gear icon[Flow Management > Manage Flow Classification].

== Omnidirectional Rules
You can mark rules as omnidirectional, which additionally evaluates the rules with interchanged endpoint addresses and ports.
This is helpful if traffic related to a matching classification should be classified the same way.

[[rule-groups]]
== Rule Groups
Rules live within a rule group.
New groups can be added, edited, and deleted via the Classification UI.
The `pre-defined` group is read only.
You cannot alter it or its rules.

[[evaluation-order]]
== Order of Evaluation
Rules and groups have a position.
Lower positions are evaluated first.
The position of a rules group is more important than the rule's position within its group.
The system-defined group is always evaluated last.

An example of an evaluation:

[options="header"]
|===
| Group Position | Group   | Rule Position | Rule
| 1              | group 1 | 1             | rule 1.1
| 1              | group 1 | 2             | rule 1.2
| 1              | group 1 | 3             | rule 1.3
| 1              | group 1 | 4             | rule 1.4
| 2              | group 2 | 1             | rule 2.1
| 2              | group 2 | 2             | rule 2.2
| 2              | group 2 | 3             | rule 2.3
| 2              | group 2 | 4             | rule 2.4
| 3              | group 3 | 1             | rule 3.1
| 3              | group 3 | 2             | rule 3.2
|===

Change the positions of rules and groups by drag and drop or by editing the position field in the edit dialogs.

== Verification

With a more complex set of rules, it is not always easy to verify if everything is configured correctly.
To make things easier, the Classification UI lets you test/verify a classification.
To do so, navigate to the Classification UI:
menu:Gear icon[Flow Management > Manage Flow Classification] and select the Test classification icon in the top right.
This simulates sending a flow to the Classification Engine with certain fields.

== Example

Let's assume the following rules are defined:

[options="header"]
|===
| name       |  srcAddress | srcPort | dstAddress | dstPort           | protocol | exporterFilter
| OpenNMS    |             |         | 10.0.0.1   | 8980              | tcp,udp  |
| http       |             |         |            | 80,8980,8080,9000 | udp,tcp  |
| https      |             |         |            | 443               |          |
| Exporters  |             |         |            |                   |          | categoryName == 'Exporters'
|===

The following flows are sent to {page-component-title} and with the rules defined above classified accordingly.
