= Transparent Bridge Discovery

Discovering Layer 2 network links using the bridge forwarding table (BFT) requires a special algorithm.
Link discovery links implements an algorithm based on a scientific paper, link:https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.383.8579&rep=rep1&type=pdf[Topology Discovery for Large Ethernet Networks].
The gathered information is used to classify links in macLink and bridgeLink.
A macLink represents a link between a workstation or server identified by a MAC address.
A bridgeLink is a connection between backbone ports.
A Shared Segment is a connection among workstations or servers (several mac addresses) and backbone ports (for example devices connected via an hub).
A bridgeLink is a a shared segment with only two bridge backbone ports.
A macLink is a shared segment with only a bridge port and only one MAC address.
A broadcast domain is a collection of shared segments based on common set of MAC addresses.

Discovery Bridge Broadcast Domains is made in two steps, the first step regards data collection.
The BridgeDiscovery Collector collects the Bridge Forwarding Table and other spanning tree information.
The BTF is not persisted into database and is maintained in memory to be processed by the BridgeDomainDiscovery.
BridgeDomainDiscovery runs the specified algorithm over collected BFT and will produce a bridge domain or several bridge domains depending on the broadcast set of MAC addresses found.
A bridge domains is a collection of shared segments based on common set of MAC addresses.

BridgeDomainDiscovery does not support multi VLAN, the bridge network model identifies a bridge for every VLAN.
Each VLAN has its own bridge forwarding table and its own spanning tree.
To discover a bridge topology the algorithm has to be run against every bridge and every vlan.
Actually the discovery is run only against the main VLAN.

Bridge domains provide no information about layer 3; only a layer 2 map of the broadcast domains.
You can determine which layer 3 interfaces map to layer 2 if your device supports the https://oidref.com/1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22[IpNetToMedia table].
In this manner, we can associate a MAC address with the corresponding IP address and then the associated node.
The Bridge Topology Updater combines the information stored in bridge domains with the ipnettomedia data and provided Bridge OnmsTopology.

Whenever possible, the Bridge Topology Updater tries to associate a MAC address to an IP address and then to a node.
It can happen that the specified MAC address and the IP address are not associated with a single node (for example, because there are duplicate nodes or because the nodes support a protocol like LACP).
As the Bridge Topology Updater does not support LACP, and other similar aggregation protocols, we do not resolve the node and record the association found as a mac:ip relationship for a specific vertex.

Transparent bridging is not loop free, so if you have loops you must enable the spanning tree protocol that detects loops and will put some ports in a blocking state to avoid loops.
To get links it is necessary to perform some calculations that let us define the links.
The SNMP agent must support the following MIBS to allow Transparent Bridge Discovery.

If the device does not support VTP, the version is none(3).

| ipNetToMediaIfIndex
| The interface on which this entry's equivalence is effective
The layer-2 interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of ifIndex.
| .1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.1

| ipNetToMediaPhysAddress
| The media-dependent physical address.
| .1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.2

| ipNetToMediaNetAddress
| The IpAddress corresponding to the media-dependent physical address.
| .1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.3

| ipNetToMediaType
| The type of mapping. Setting this object to the value `invalid(2)` invalidates the corresponding entry in the ipNetToMediaTable. 
That effectively disassociates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry.
It is an implementation-specific matter whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table.
Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that correspond to entries not currently in use.
Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant ipNetToMediaType object.

| dot1dStpPortState
| The port's current state as defined by application of the Spanning Tree Protocol.
This state controls what action a port takes on reception of a frame.
If the bridge detects a port that is malfunctioning it places that port into the broken(6) state.
For ports that are disabled (see dot1dStpPortEnable), this object will have a value of disabled(1).
