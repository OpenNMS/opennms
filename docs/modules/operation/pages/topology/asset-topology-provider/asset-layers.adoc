[[asset-layers]]
= Asset Layers

The entries for `assetLayers` can be any node or asset entry from the following list (defined in class NodeParamLabels).
Keys beginning with `node-` come from the node table.
Keys beginning with `parent-` come from the node table entry of the designated parent node (if defined).
Keys beginning with `asset-` come from the corresponding asset table entry for the given node (if defined).

|===

This lets you generate arbitrary topologies, including physical fields (room, rack) and logical fields (asset node categories).
You should not put any spaces in the comma-separated `assetLayers` list.
If the `assetLayers` property is defined as empty, then a single graph layer is generated containing all OpenNMS nodes.
