= View the topology

After installing the topology and refreshing your screen, you should see a new topology display option in the {page-component-title} topology page.
The label field provides the displayed name of this topology.

The label field does not need to be the same as the providerId that the REST API uses for the installation or removal of a topology.
However, the label field must be unique across all installed topologies.

It is possible to have several topologies installed that have been generated using different configurations.
You must ensure that the providerId and label field used for each installation command are different.

IMPORTANT: You must first uninstall a {page-component-title} GraphML topology before installing an updated version of the same topology.
You will have to log out and log back into the UI to see the new topology file.
If you uninstall a topology while viewing it, the UI throws an error and you will have to log out and back in to see the remaining topologies.
