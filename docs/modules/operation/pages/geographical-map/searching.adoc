# Map Search

The search bar lets you do a simple text search, as well as searching particular fields associated with the node.

## Search fields

You can search the following fields:

[options="header"]
[cols="2*"]
|====
| Field
| Description

| nodeId
| The ID of the node

| nodeLabel
| A text description

| foreignSource
| The provisioned foreign source, if any

| foreignId
| The provisioned foreign ID, if any

| ipAddress
| The primary IP address

| severityLabel
| The severity ("Normal", "Warning", etc.)

| description
| The description field from the node's assets

| maintContract
| The maintenance contract from the node's assets

| category
| Match a category, if any

|====

Note that all searches are case-insensitive.

## Substring matching example

To search for text in one of the fields, use the following syntax:

`fieldname:searchtext`

If the search is `nodelabel:server` it will match a node's label like `server1.opennms.com` or `server2.opennms.com`.

### Exact Matching Example

To search for an exact match of a field, use the following syntax:

`fieldname=searchtext`

If the search is `nodelabel=server1.opennms.com` it will only match a node's label like `server1.opennms.com`.

## Link to a search

It is possible to create a link to the `node-maps` URL that already has a pre-filled search defintion by adding a `#search/searchtext` into the URL.

For example, to link to the node label search from the substring match example above, write the URL as follows:

`\http://opennms-ip/opennms/node-maps#search/nodelabel:server`


Or to search for the exact node label match:

`\http://opennms-ip/opennms/node-maps#search/nodelabel=server1.opennms.com`
