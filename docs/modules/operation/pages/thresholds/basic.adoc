[[threshold-bw]]
= Basic Walk-Through

This section describes how to create a basic threshold for a single, system-wide variable: the number of logged-in users.
Our threshold will tell {page-component-title} to create an event when the number of logged-in users on the device exceeds two, and re-arm when it falls below two.

Before creating a threshold, you need to make sure you are collecting the metric against which you want to threshold.

[[metric-collect]]
== Determine you are collecting metric
In this case, we have chosen a metric (number of logged-in users) that is collected by default.
We are also using data collected via SNMP. (For information on other collectors, see <<performance-data-collection/collectors.adoc#collectors-overview,Collectors>>.)

. In the {page-component-title} UI, choose *Reports>Resource Graphs*.
. Select one of the listed resources.
. Under *SNMP Node Data*, select *Node-level Performance Data* and choose *Graph Selection*.
. Scroll to find the *Number of Users* graph.
.. You can click the binoculars icon to display only this graph.
