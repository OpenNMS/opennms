= Determine the Data Source
Creating a threshold requires the name of the data source generating the metrics on which you want to threshold.
Data source names for the SNMP protocol appear in `etc/snmp-graph.properties.d/`.

. To determine the name of the data source, navigate to the *Resource Graphs* screen.
For example,
.. *Reports>Resource Graphs*.
.. Select one of the listed resources.
.. Under *SNMP Node Data*, select *Node-level Performance Data* and choose *Graph Selection*.
. Scroll through the graphs to find the title of the graph that displays the metric on which you want to threshold.
For example, "Number of Processes" or "System Uptime":

. Go to `etc/snmp-graph.properties.d/` and search for the title of the graph (for example, "System Uptime").

. Note the name of the data source, and type it in the *Datasource* field when you xref:thresholds/create-thresh.adoc#threshold-create[create your threshold].
