= Use Metadata in a Threshold

Metadata in expression-based thresholds can streamline threshold creation.
The <<meta-data.adoc#ga-meta-data-dsl, Metadata DSL>> (domain specific language) lets you use patterns in an expression, whereby the metadata is replaced with a corresponding value during the collection process.
A single expression can behave differently based on the node being tested against.

During evaluation of an expression, the following scopes are available:

* Node metadata
* Interface metadata
* Service metadata

Metadata is also supported in Value, Re-arm, and Trigger fields for Single-DS and expression-based thresholds.

NOTE: For more information on metadata and how to define it, see <<meta-data.adoc#metadata-overview
, Metadata>>.


== Example

This procedure uses metadata to trigger an event when the number of logged-in users exceeds 1.

The expression is in the form `${context:key|context_fallback:key_fallback|...|default}`.

Before using metadata in a threshold, you need to add the metadata context pair, in this case, a requisition key called userLimit (see <<meta-data.adoc#ga-metadata-webui, Adding metadata through the web UI>>).

. Click the gear icon in the top-right menu.
. Under *Performance Measurement*, choose *Configure Thresholds*.
. Click *Edit* beside the *netsnmp* group.
. Click *Create New Expression-based Threshold*.
. Fill in the following information:

+
* Type: High
* Expression: `hrSystemNumUsers / ${requisition:userLimit|1}`
* Datasource type: Node
* Value: 1
* Rearm: 1
* Description: Too many logged-in users

. Click *Save*.

This expression will trigger an event when the number of logged-in users exceeds 1.
