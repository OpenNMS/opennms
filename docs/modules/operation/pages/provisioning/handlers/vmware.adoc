= VMWare Handler

The VMware adapter pulls hosts and/or virtual machines from a vCenter server into {page-component-title}.
With this adapter, nodes can automatically be added, updated, or removed from your {page-component-title} based on the status of the VMware entity.
The adapter also lets {page-component-title} collect additional performance metrics directly from the VMware server based on stats stored by the hypervisor.

== Preparing VMware credentials

To allow communication between OpenNMS and VMware, you must create a user and a role for authentication and permissions.
You can either create a new local user within your vCenter server or use an account that has been defined in an external authentication system that is set up to access your vCenter instance.

.Create a new vCenter role:
. Log into vCenter Server.
. Go to menu:Home[Administration > Roles].
. Select the built-in "Read Only" role.
. Select the option to clone the role and name the new role "OpenNMS-Access" (or another name to your preference).
. Edit the new role to add the menu:Host[CIM > CIM Interaction] permission.
. Click OK to save the role.

.Assign OpenNMS user permissions to access vCenter objects:
. Navigate to menu:Home[Inventory > Hosts and Clusters] within your vCenter.
. Right click on the container to apply the permission.
If you want {page-component-title} to import all entities, this would be the root vCenter level.
To import only a subset of nodes, select a specific data center, cluster, or host.
. Select the Add Permission option from the right-click menu.
. Enter the name of the user account to use to connect to vCenter during the import process.
. Select the "OpenNMS-Access" role (or whatever you called it in the previous step).
. Save the role assignment and make sure to propagate to child objects, if prompted.

== Provide credentials to {page-component-title}

Now that vCenter has been configured to allow access to read objects, it is time to set up {page-component-title} to be able to connect to vCenter.
In the `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/vmware-config.xml` file, add a line with the hostname, user, and password to connect to your vCenter server.
If you have multiple vCenter servers, you can specify multiple `<vmware-server />` objects in this file.

[source, xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<vmware-config>
    <vmware-server hostname="vcenter.mydomain.org" username="OpenNMS" password="secret"/>
</vmware-config>
----

== Configure VMware requisition

The final step is to set up a requisition definition in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/provisiond-configuration.xml`.
Use the `vmware://` prefix to create a `<requisition-def>` object for the vCenter server.

[source, xml]
----
<requisition-def import-name="vCenter" <1>
    import-url-resource="vmware://vcenter.mydomain.org"> <2>
    <cron-schedule>0 42 23 * * ? *</cron-schedule> <3>
</requisition-def>
----

<1> The name of the requisition to appear within {page-component-title}.
<2> The hostname defined in the `provisiond-configuration.xml` must match the same case as the hostname entered in the `vmware-config.xml`.
<3> The schedule of how frequently the import should rerun.
In this example, the import runs every day at 23:42.

By default, all running hosts and virtual machines will be detected and added to the requisition.
Change this behavior by adding additional parameters to the `import-url-resource` parameter in the requisition definition.

Do not forget to restart services after making changes to the `provisiond-configuration.xml` file.

| importVMAll
| Imports all virtual machines and ignores importVMPoweredOn, importVMPoweredOff, and importVMSuspended parameters.
| false

| importVMOnly
| Imports only virtual machines and ignores hosts.
| false

| importHostPoweredOn
| Defines if powered-on host systems should be imported.
| true

| importHostPoweredOff
| Defines if powered-off host systems should be imported.
| false

| importHostStandBy
| Defines if stand-by host systems should be imported.
| false

| importHostUnknown
| Defines if host systems with an unknown power state should be imported.
| false

| importHostAll

| false

| importHostOnly
| Imports only host systems and ignores VMs.
| false

| virtualMachineServices
| Monitor services to assign to imported virtual machines.
Multiple values should be comma separated.
| VMware-ManagedEntity, VMware-VirtualMachine

| hostSystemServices
| Monitor services to assign to imported host systems.
Multiple values should be comma separated.
| VMware-ManagedEntity, VMware-HostSystem, VMwareCim-HostSystem

| timeout
| VMware connection timeout, in milliseconds.
| 3000

| cimTimeout
| Timeout, in milliseconds, used to test interface addresses for a reachable CIM service.

| 3000
|===

IMPORTANT: `importVMOnly` and `importHostOnly` cannot both be true simultaneously. +
`importIPv4Only` and `importIPv6Only` cannot both be true simultaneously.

NOTE: If you do not import powered-off or standby entities, they will be removed and re-added to {page-component-title} based on their power state.
This can cause their database ID to change over time.
Enabling the https://opennms.discourse.group/t/storing-data-with-foreign-sources/2057[storeByForeignSource] setting can help make sure collected metrics are kept properly.



== Provision a subset of VMware entities

If you want to provision an arbitrary selection of VMware entities, you can specify a key-value pair to match objects that have a specific attribute in vCenter.
The key to look up is a user-defined attribute for entities being imported.
If the value provided starts with a `~`, the value will be treated as a regular expression.
Only one key-value pair can be specified per requisition.

[source, xml]
----
<requisition-def import-name="vmware-requisition"
    import-url-resource="vmware://<vcenter-host>/VCenterImport?key=OpenNMS-Import;value=yes">
----

If you need to specify several attributes, use the `_[customAttributeName]` parameter

[source, xml]
----
<requisition-def import-name="vmware-requisition"
    import-url-resource="vmware://<vcenter-host>/VCenterImport?_OpenNMS-Import=yes">
