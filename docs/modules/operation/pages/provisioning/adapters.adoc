= Adapters

The {page-component-title} Provisiond API supports provisioning adapters (plugins) for integration with external systems during the provisioning import phase.
These adapters let OpenNMS exchange data with other systems, allowing the enrichment of node data.

== Supported adapters

For information on supported adapters and how to configure them, see xref:reference:provisioning/adapters/introduction.adoc[adapters reference section].
