= DDNS Adapter

The DDNS adapter uses the dynamic DNS protocol to send updated DNS records to your DNS system as nodes are provisioned into {{page-component-title}.
To configure this adapter, create a .properties file in  the `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/opennms.properties.d/` folder and set the `importer.adapter.dns.server property`:
