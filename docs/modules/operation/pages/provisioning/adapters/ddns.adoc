= DDNS Adapter

The DDNS adapter uses the dynamic DNS protocol to send updated DNS records to your DNS system as nodes are provisioned into {page-component-title}.
To configure this adapter, create a .properties file in  the `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/opennms.properties.d/` folder and set the `importer.adapter.dns.server property`:

[source, properties]
----
importer.adapter.dns.server=192.168.1.1 <1>
----
<1> Replace with the IP address of your DNS server to receive dynamic DNS updates.
