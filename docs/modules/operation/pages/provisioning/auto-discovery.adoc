= Auto Discovery

Auto discovery is the process of automatically adding nodes to {page-component-title}.
You do this through discovery, either periodically on schedule or through single, unscheduled times.

Make sure you complete the tasks in the <<provisioning/getting-started.adoc#provision-getting-started, Getting Started>> section before adding nodes.
