= SNMP Interface Policy

This policy controls the whether discovered SNMP interface entities are to be persisted and whether or not {page-component-title} should collect performance metrics from the SNMP agent for specific SNMP interfaces.

[options="header"]
|===
| Action             | Description
| DISABLE_COLLECTION | Disallow collecting performance metrics on the interface.
| DISABLE_POLLING    | Disallow SNMP polling on the interface.
| DO_NOT_PERSIST     | Prevent the SNMP interface from being added to the node.
| ENABLE_COLLECTION  | Allow collecting performance metrics on the interface.
| ENABLE_POLLING     | Allow SNMP polling on the interface.
|===

Another use of this policy is to mark interfaces for polling by the <<snmp-poller/concepts.adoc#snmp-interface-poller, SNMP Interface Poller>>.
The SNMP Interface Poller is a separate daemon that is disabled by default.
In order for this daemon to do any work, some SNMP interfaces need to be selected for polling.

Use the `ENABLE_POLLING` and `DISABLE_POLLING` actions available in this policy to manage which SNMP interfaces this daemon polls.
