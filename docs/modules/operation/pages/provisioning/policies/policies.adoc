= Policies

The Policy API in Provisiond allows you to control the persistence of discovered IP and SNMP Interface entities and Node Categories during the Scan phase.

Policies are defined by editing the foreign source definition (Edit Definition button) of a requisition.

== Common policy parameters

The matchBehavior action is a boolean control that determines how the optional parameters will be evaluated.
Setting this parameterâ€™s value to `ALL_PARAMETERS` causes Provisiond to evaluate each optional parameter with boolean AND logic and the value `ANY_PARAMETERS` will cause OR logic to be applied.
