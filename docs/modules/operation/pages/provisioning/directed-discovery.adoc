= Directed Discovery

Directed discovery is the process of manually adding nodes to {page-component-title} through the requisition UI.
Two other methods for manually adding nodes (quick add node and manually adding an interface) are in the process of being deprecated. We do not recommend using these features.

Make sure you complete the tasks in the <<provisioning/getting-started.adoc#provision-getting-started, Getting Started>> section before adding nodes.

[[requisition-add-nodes]]
== Add nodes through the Requisition UI

Before adding nodes to a requisition, you must <<provisioning/getting-started.adoc#requisition-create, create a requisition>>.

. In the web UI, click the gear icon in the top right.
. In the *Provisioning* area, choose *Manage Provisioning Requisition*.
. Click the edit icon beside the requisition you want to add nodes to.
. Click *Add Node*.
.. {page-component-title} auto-generates the foreign ID used to identify this node.
. Fill out information in each of the tabs and click *Save*.

* basic information (node label, auto-generated foreign ID, location)
* path outage (configure network path to limit notifications from nodes behind other nodes, see <<service-assurance/path-outages#ga-service-assurance-path-outage, Path Outages>>)
* interfaces (add interface IP addresses and services)
* assets (pre-defined metadata types)
* categories (label/tag for type of node, e.g., routers, production, switches)
* meta-data (customized asset information)

. Repeat for each node you want to add.
. Click *Return* to view the list of nodes you have added.
. Click *Synchronize* to provision them to the {page-component-title} database.
