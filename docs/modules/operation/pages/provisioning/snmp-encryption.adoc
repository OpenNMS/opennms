== Encrypt SNMP credentials

You can save SNMP credentials like readCommunity/WriteCommunity and authPassPhrase/privPassPhrase on the file system in encrypted format.

=== Encryption methodology

A random password is generated (once) for `snmp-config` alias and stored in the Java keystore file at `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/scv.jce`.
This password is used to encrypt and decrypt SNMP credentials.

=== Enable encryption on SNMP configuration

Enable encryption on SNMP configuration by setting the following system property:
[source, sh]
----
echo 'org.opennms.snmp.encryption.enabled=true' >> "$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/opennms.properties.d/snmp-encryption.properties"
----

SNMP configuration modified through the user interface is encrypted immediately on the file system.

=== Karaf command to encrypt credentials

Use the following Karaf command to encrypt SNMP credentials.
This is useful when you want to update SNMP configuration directly on the file and encrypt it immediately.

[source, console]
----
$ ssh -p 8101 admin@localhost
...
admin@opennms()> snmp-config-encrypt
----

=== Karaf command to decrypt credentials

Use the following Karaf command to decrypt SNMP credentials.
By default, the decrypted configuration gets copied to `snmp-config-decrypted.xml`.


[source, console]
----
$ ssh -p 8101 admin@localhost
...
admin@opennms()> snmp-config-decrypt -f "snmp-config-decrypted.xml"
----
