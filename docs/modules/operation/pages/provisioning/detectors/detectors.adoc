= Detectors

This section describes the available service detectors that the Provisiond service can use to automatically add services to nodes for monitoring and collecting metrics.

[[ga-provisioning-meta-data]]
== Metadata DSL
Service detectors can use <<meta-data.adoc#ga-meta-data-dsl, MetaData DSL>> (domain specific language) to leverage dynamic configuration in parameter values to interpolate metadata into the parameter.

The syntax lets you use patterns in an expression, whereby the metadata is replaced with a corresponding value during the collection process.

During evaluation of an expression, the following scopes are available:

* Node metadata
* Interface metadata
