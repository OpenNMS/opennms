= Win32 Service Detector

Use the Win32 Service Detector to detect the availability of services on Windows devices with SNMP enabled.
It will query the Microsoft LAN Manager MIB `.1.3.6.1.4.1.77` over SNMP to confirm the service exists and is active.
The given `win32ServiceName` parameter is converted into the decimal ASCII characters of the Windows service display name.
A service is detected when the OID returns active(1) from the _svSvcOperatingState_ (`.1.3.6.1.4.1.77.1.2.3.1.3`) table.

NOTE: The suffix is constructed by the number of characters and the decimal ASCII characters of the service display name.
      Display names in Microsoft Windows depend on the language settings of the operating system and may differ.
      As an example, the display name for the _Task Scheduler_ has 14 characters and becomes OID suffix `14.84.97.115.107.32.83.99.104.101.100.117.108.101.114`.

TIP: You can query the _svSvcName_ table (`1.3.6.1.4.1.77.1.2.3.1.1`) to identify the display name which can be used as a _win32ServiceName_ in the detector.
