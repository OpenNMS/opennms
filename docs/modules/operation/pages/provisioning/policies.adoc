= Policies

The Policy API in Provisiond allows you to control the persistence of discovered IP and SNMP interface entities and node categories during the scan phase.

Edit the foreign source definition (`Edit Definition` button) of a requisition to define policies.

== Common policy parameters

The matchBehavior action is a boolean control that determines how the optional parameters will be evaluated.
Setting this parameter’s value to `ALL_PARAMETERS` causes Provisiond to evaluate each optional parameter with boolean AND logic and the value `ANY_PARAMETERS` causes OR logic to be applied.

String values are assumed to be a substring match, unless the parameter is prefixed with `~` to indicate the policy should evaluate as a regular expression.

== Supported policies

For information on supported policies and how to configure them, see xref:reference:provisioning/policies.adoc[policies reference section].
