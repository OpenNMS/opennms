= Boost Configuration

You can increase the frequency of certain dashlets in an xref:deep-dive/visualizations/opsboard/introduction.adoc[operator board] by modifying the following settings:

* *Boost Priority:* The absolute priority of the dashlet.
Lower numbers indicate a higher priority; this results in the dashlet being displayed more often in the rotation.
One is the highest priority, so a dashlet assigned it appears the most frequently.
* *Boost Duration:* The absolute display duration (in seconds) of the dashlet.
