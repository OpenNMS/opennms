:description: How to use the SSH scripting engine for device configuration backup and details about vendor TFTP support in {page-component-title}.

{page-component-title} uses an SSH scripting engine to run the commands on devices to upload their configuration settings.
You must create a script for each device type whose configuration you want to back up, and save the scripts in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/device-config`.
Each script simulates an interactive session with the network device, and tells the device to create a backup of its configuration.
The backup is then sent to a TFTP server which is operated by either {page-component-title} or a Minion.

NOTE: Some devices may distinguish between different types of configuration settings (for example, startup configuration versus running configuration).
{page-component-title} treats configuration types as arbitrary strings, and uses `default` when no configuration type is specified.

You will reference these scripts when you xref:deep-dive/device-config-backup/dcb-requisition.adoc[create a requisition] for a device of each type.

== SSH scripting engine

The scripting engine supports two commands:

* `send: ...`: Sends the given string to the device.
* `await: ...`: Waits for a response from the device that matches the given string.

Scripts can reference the following variables by using `$\{varname}` notation:

.SSH scripting variables
[options="autowidth"]
|===
| Name  | Description

| tftpServerIp
| TFTP server's IP address

| tftpServerPort
| TFTP server's port number

| filenameSuffix
| Suffix that must be appended to the file name before uploading.
{page-component-title} uses this additional suffix to identify incoming uploads.

| configType
| Configuration type.
If not specified, this is set to `default`.
|===

NOTE: Uploaded configuration files should include filename extensions like `.zip` or `.gz` that specify their file type.
You must also append the script variable `filenameSuffix` to the file name; this indicates that the file is set to upload.

=== Example

This example script is for a Juniper SRX firewall.
You will need to modify it to configure other device types.

[source, script]
----
await: >
send: start shell
await: %
send: cd /config
await: %
send: tftp ${tftpServerIp}
await: tftp>
send: put juniper.conf.gz juniper.conf.gz${filenameSuffix}
await: tftp>
send: exit

== Vendor TFTP support

See your device manufacturer's official documentation for details on their TFTP support.

There are several example scripts available in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/examples/device-config`:

=== Configure DCB user accounts

We recommend that you limit the privileges of any user accounts used for configuration retrieval.
The following examples demonstrate how to configure a `dcb` user account, specify its password (`Pa55w0rd`), and limit its privileges to only configuration retrieval commands.
