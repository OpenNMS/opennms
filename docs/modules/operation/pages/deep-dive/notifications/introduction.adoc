= Notifications

{page-component-title} uses notifications to inform users about an event that happened in the network, without the user having to log in and look at the UI.

Common notification methods are email and paging, but notification mechanisms also exist for:

* Browser-based desktop notifications
* Arbitrary HTTP GET and POST operations
* Arbitrary external commands
* Asterisk call origination
* IRCcat Internet Relay Chat bot
* SNMP traps
* Slack, Mattermost, and other API-compatible team chat platforms
* Twitter, GNU Social, and other API-compatible microblog services
* User-provided scripts in any JSR-223 compatible language
* XMPP

The notification daemon Notifd creates and sends notifications according to configured rules when selected events occur in {page-component-title}.
