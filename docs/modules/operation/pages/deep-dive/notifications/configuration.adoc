This section presents more advanced notification configuration options.

== Configure path outages

Path outages prevent the generation of excess notifications by identifying network paths where failures may cause multiple nodes to appear offline.

Configuring a path outage lets you suppress notifications for nodes that appear to be down due to a failure in the network path between the nodes and {page-component-title}.
For example, if a WAN link fails, all nodes at the remote site served by the WAN link will appear to be down.
Because you get a notification that the router on the far end of the WAN link is not responding, you don't need notifications for all devices that sit behind that router.

See xref:operation:deep-dive/service-assurance/path-outages.adoc[Use Path Outages to Suppress Notifications] for information on enabling this feature.
Path outage checking is disabled by default.

You can configure a path outage for an individual node by setting a parent on the node in a requisition or by doing the following:

. Click the *gear* symbol in the top-right of the screen.
. Under Event Management, click menu:Configure Notifications[Configure Path Outages].
. Enter the critical path IP address, select a critical path service, and click *Validate Rule Results*.
. Click *Next* to save the configuration.
