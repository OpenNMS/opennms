:description: How to use the PagerDuty Plugin to configure {page-component-title} to send incidents through PagerDuty.

If your organization uses https://pagerduty.com/[PagerDuty], this plugin allows you to configure {page-component-title} to create PagerDuty incidents that correspond to alarms in OpenNMS by integrating with PagerDuty's https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/events-api-v2/overview/[Events API v2]

OpenNMS alarms map naturally to incidents in PagerDuty:

* Events create incidents
* Events are deduplicated by the `dedup_key` (or `reduction key` in OpenNMS)
* Incidents can be acknowledged while someone is working on the problem
* Incidents are cleared when there is no longer a problem
