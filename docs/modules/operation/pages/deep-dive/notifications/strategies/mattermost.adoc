= Mattermost

If your organization uses the Mattermost team communications platform, you can configure {page-component-title} to send notices to any Mattermost channel via an incoming webhook.
You must configure an incoming webhook in your Mattermost team and do a bit of manual configuration to your {page-component-title} instance.

First, add the following bit of XML to the `notificationCommands.xml` configuration file (no customization should be needed):

[source, xml]
----
<command binary="false">
  <name>mattermost</name>
  <execute>org.opennms.netmgt.notifd.MattermostNotificationStrategy</execute>
  <comment>class for sending messages to a Mattermost team channel for notifications</comment>
  <argument streamed="false">
    <switch>-subject</switch>
  </argument>
  <argument streamed="false">
    <switch>-tm</switch>
  </argument>
</command>
----

Then create a new file called `mattermost.properties` in the `opennms.properties.d` directory with the following contents (customizing values as appropriate):

[source, properties]
----
org.opennms.netmgt.notifd.mattermost.webhookURL=https://mattermost.example.com/hooks/bf980352b5f7232efe721dbf0626bee1
----

Restart OpenNMS so that the `mattermost.properties` file will be loaded. Your new `mattermost` notification command is now available for use in a destination path.

== Additional options
The following table lists optional properties that you may use in `mattermost.properties` to customize your Mattermost notifications.

IMPORTANT: To improve the layout, the property names have been shortened to their final component; you must prepend `org.opennms.netmgt.notifd.mattermost.` when using them.
