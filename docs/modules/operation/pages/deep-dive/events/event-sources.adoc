= Sources of Events

Events may originate within {page-component-title} itself or from outside.

Internally-generated events can be the result of the platform's monitoring and management functions (for example, a monitored node becoming  unavailable, resulting in an event with the UEI `uei.opennms.org/nodes/nodeDown`) or they may act as inputs or outputs of housekeeping processes.
