= Advanced Event Search

Often users wish to query the event list with more customizations to narrow down the search.
The {page-component-title} event detail page has a button to filter your searches based on different criteria.

Choose from the following search criteria:

* Event ID
** Performs an equals filter on the event ID.

* Node Label Contains
** Performs a substring filter on the node label.
** To negate this search, prefix the input text with `!`.
This returns results that do not contain the provided input text.

* Event Text Contains
** Performs a substring filter on both the log message and the description.
** To negate this search, prefix the input text with `!`.
This returns results that do not contain the provided input text.

* TCP/IP Address Like
** Performs an `IPLIKE` on the provided IP Address to filter the results.
** To negate this search, prefix the input text with `!`.
This returns results that do not satisfy the `IPLIKE` function.

* Node Location
** Select from the dropdown to filter results to only this Node Location.
** Choose `Any` to return all results.

* System ID
** Select from the dropdown to filter results to only this System ID.

* Severity
** Filter the event list based on the event severity.
** This is a multi-select checkbox.

Selecting one or multiple severities restricts your search results to those selected.
