= Event Troubleshooting

This section describes how to troubleshoot events in {page-component-title}.

== Debugging

When debugging events, it may be helpful to lower the minimum severity at which eventd will log from the default level of `WARN`.
To change this setting, edit `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/log4j2.xml` and locate the following line:

[source, xml]
<KeyValuePair key="eventd" value="WARN" />

Changes to `log42.xml` will take effect within 60 seconds with no further action needed.

At the `DEBUG` level, eventd will log a verbose description of every event it handles to `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/logs/eventd.log`.
On busy systems, this setting may create so much noise as to be impractical.
In these cases, you can get terse event summaries by setting eventd to log at level `INFO` and setting `logEventSummaries="yes"` in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/eventd-configuration.xml`.

[[send-event]]
== Manually send events

You can manually create and send an event to trigger processes inside of {page-component-title} through the UI or using the <<event-utility, `send-event.pl` utility>>.
In most cases, you would do this to reload daemon configuration without having to restart {page-component-title}.

[[send-event-ui]]
To manually send an event in the web UI, follow these steps:

. Click the *gear* symbol in the top-right corner of the screen.
. Under Event Management, select *Manually Send an Event*.
. Select an event from the *Event* list, and specify additional information (UUID, node ID, parameters, severity, and so on).
. Click *Send Event*.
. To view the event, click menu:Status[Events] in the top menu bar, and click *All Events*.
The event that you created is shown at the top of the list.

[[event-utility]]
=== send-event.pl utility

In addition to manually adding events, you can also use the `send-event.pl` utility as an automation tool to trigger events as part of continuous integration scripts or other automated processes.
For example, you can use the utility to do the following:

* Create a new suspect event every time you add a new resource.
* Clear out alarms.
* Open a ticket in your integrated ticketing system.
* Send a notification reminder to order new ink cartridges when your printer is out of toner.

Commands for the utility should follow the `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/bin/send-event.pl <uei> [host:port] [options]` format.
The `host:port` defines the hostname and port to send the event; by default, it points to the local host.

You can find UEIs and their associated parameters in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/eventd-configuration.xml` (see xref:deep-dive/events/event-configuration.adoc[]).

[caption=]
.`send-event.pl` parameters
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Name/Alias    | Description

2+|*Required*

| uei
| Unique event identifier (UEI) indicating the type of event.
You can view UEIs in `eventd-configuration.xml`.
You can also define your own UEIs.

2+|*Optional*

| -d (--description)
| Description for the event browser.

| -f (--ifindex)
| `ifIndex` of the associated service.

| -h (--help)
| Help message for the script (the content from this table).

| -i (--interface)
| IP address of associated interface.

| -l (--logmsg)
| A short log message for the event browser (secure field by default).

| -n (--nodeid)
| Database ID of associated node (or use `foreignSource`, `foreignId` parameters).

| -p (-parameter)
| Parameter in `key=value` form (for example, `-p 'url \http://www.opennms.com/'`).

| -s (--service)
| Name of the associated service.

| -x (--severity)
| Severity of the event: +
1 = Indeterminate +
2 = Cleared +
3 = Normal +
4 = Warning +
5 = Minor +
6 = Major +
7 = Critical +

| -t (--timezone)
| Your time zone.

| -v (--verbose)
| Print the raw XML that is generated.

| -V (--version)
| Print version and exit successfully.
|===

Note that parameter descriptions use the percentage sign (`%`) as a delimiter to mark a replacement variable (see xref:deep-dive/events/event-tokens.adoc[]).
If a literal percent sign appears in your description, you must escape it with a `%` (for example, `'testUrl \https://www.opennms.org/ReportSection?filter=FOO_BAR_BAZ%%20eq%%20%%27101%%27'`).

=== Example

Send an event to reload the eventd configuration:

[source, console]
$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/bin/send-event.pl -p 'daemonName Eventd' uei.opennms.org/internal/reloadDaemonConfig

== Karaf Shell

Use the `opennms:show-event-config` command to render the event definition for one or more event UEIs (matching a substring) to XML.
This command is useful to display event definitions that may not be easily accessible on disk, or to verify that particular events were actually loaded:

[source, karaf]
opennms:show-event-config -u uei.opennms.org/alarms
