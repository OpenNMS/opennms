= Sink

Events can also be created by routing them to a specific topic on Kafka/ActiveMQ.

The topic name should be of the form `OpenNMS.Sink.Events` where `OpenNMS` is the default instance ID of {page-component-title}.
The instance ID is configurable through a system property `org.opennms.instance.id`.
