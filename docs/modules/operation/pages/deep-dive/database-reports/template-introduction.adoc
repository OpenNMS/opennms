= Report Templates

{page-component-title} includes a number of <<deep-dive/database-reports/database.adoc#db-report-sample-templates, sample report templates>>.
You can use them as-is, modify them, or use them as examples on which to base your own custom report templates.

== Report scheduling and delivery

When you configure a report template, the last two checkboxes for most let you set the delivery and scheduling settings for the report.
Selecting *Deliver This Report* displays the following delivery options:

* *Unique Name:* The report's name.
This must be unique among all scheduled reports.
* *Format:* Specify PDF or CSV.
* *Delivery Options:*
** *Save a Copy of the Report:* Save a copy of the report to your {page-component-title} instance.
You can view it from the *Persisted Reports* tab.
** *Email Report:* A comma-separated list of email addresses to which the report will be emailed.
** *Webhook:* A specified HTTP endpoint to which the report will be posted when it is generated.

Selecting *Schedule This Report* displays the following scheduling options:

* *Daily*.
* *Days per Week:* Specify days of the week on which the report will run.
* *Days per Month:* Specify days of the month on which the report will run (for example, the third Sunday of each month).
* *Cron Expression*.

NOTE: Each scheduling option has additional fields associated with it, such as *Days of the Week*, *Interval*, and *Specific Time*.

After you set the delivery and scheduling information, you can click *Deliver Report* to generate the report and save, email, or webhook it as specified.
A list of scheduled reports is displayed in the *Report Schedules* tab.
