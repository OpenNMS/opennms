= Interface Availability Report
:description: Learn how to create an Interface Availability report in {page-component-title}, which summarizes interface availability for interfaces with outages.

This report shows a summary of interface availability for interfaces with outages.
It's a multi-page report that provides the following data for all router interfaces, organized by IP address, over the specified date range:

* Number of outages.
* Mean Time To Repair ("MTTR") (in hours).
* Length of time for each outage (in hours).
* Percent outage (per unit in category).
* Percent availability (per unit in category).

//QUESTION: Need to validate explanation of the last two, in the summary chart at the end, are these averages over the entire period or per day?

This report can be customized with a company logo (approximately 195px by 50px) in both the header and footer.

For an example of an availability report, see xref:deep-dive/database-reports/template-introduction.adoc[].
