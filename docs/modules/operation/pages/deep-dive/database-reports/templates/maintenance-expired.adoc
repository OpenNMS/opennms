= Maintenance Contracts Expired Report

This is an asset management report that shows all assets with maintenance contracts that will expire within a threshold period, which starts on the day that the report is generated and extends for the number of days specified in the `Warning Threshold` parameter.
This report can also show assets with maintenance contracts that have already expired.

The report includes a table that lists assets that match the criteria defined by the parameters, sorted by node and then ordered by expiration date.
The report includes the node label, manufacturer, title of the maintenance contract, expiration date, and status.

This table also lists the matching assets by manufacturer, and includes the following additional information:

* Model number.
* Serial number.
* Date the contract expires.
* Operating system.
* Number of days left in contract.
* Date installed.
* Vendor phone number.

You can customize this report with three company logos (approximately 195px by 50px) in the report header, the page header, and the page footer.
