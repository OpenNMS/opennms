= Default Calendar Report
:description: Learn about the Calendar report, which contains monthly availability statistics and daily averages for all services that {page-component-title} monitors.

The default calendar report is generated directly from the {page-component-title} Java code.
As such, it has no optional parameters to modify.
It contains the same data as the xref:deep-dive/database-reports/templates/classic.adoc[default classic report], but some of the information is presented in the form of a calendar month.

The first table contains monthly availability statistics for all services monitored by {page-component-title} for the past year.
It also lists the number of nodes that had outages, the number of interfaces, and the number of services.

The next two figures present the daily average of services monitored, and the availability of services divided over the previous full month and the current month to date:

// QUESTION: The report says that the denominator is the "total svc minutes" but it is unclear whether it is using the total number of minutes in the period or the total number of minutes that the service was being monitored.  I dropped the "services" from the phrase.  I believe this is probably done taking the daily number of minutes that s service was available by the daily number of minutes that service was being monitored, and then averaging those percentagesI mention this because there are other ways that this can be calculated (e.g., Using the total number of minutes in a day as the denominator).  This should probably be checked.

The next table lists the monitored devices with the worst availability rates during the previous month.

The next table lists daily availability over the past 30 days.
The average of those 30 data points is calculated and displayed in the next table.

// QUESTION: I think the denominator here is the number of minutes that each service was monitored.  It could be total number of minutes.  This should be checked.

The next two tables show the average availability for every monitored service on each device for the previous full month, and the current month to date.

The remaining tables show the top service outages for the previous month.
Each entry lists the affected node, the duration of the outage, and the date and time when the outage occurred.
