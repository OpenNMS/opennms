= Availability Summary Report
:description: Learn about the Availability Summary report in {page-component-title}, which provides a summary of availability across one or more node tags.

This report provides a summary of availability across one or more node tags.
It is the default configuration when viewing data over the past seven days.

For each node tag, the report includes a table of average, minimum, and maximum values for the following availability data over the specified date range:

* Number of outages.
* Mean Time To Repair ("MTTR") (in hours).
* Length of time for each outage (in hours).
* Percent outage (per unit in tag).
* Percent availability (per unit in tag).

This report has a pie chart that shows a ratio of percent availability to outage time.
It then provides a stacked bar chart showing the available time and the outage time for each day in the specified date range.
The report also lists the top 25 nodes based on downtime and their respective and downtime percentages.

You can customize the report with a company logo (approximately 195px by 50px) in the header and footer.

For an example of an availability report, see xref:deep-dive/database-reports/template-introduction.adoc[].
