= Grafana Dashboard Reports

{page-component-title} provides three templates to create a PDF report from an existing Grafana dashboard.
You can also schedule and email these PDF reports to anyone, meaning you can do the following:

* Keep staff without access to {page-component-title} informed about network performance for improved capacity planning.
* Create a permanent record of strategic information and progress over a long period of time.

The PDF report displays each of the panels from the specified dashboard, with one, two, or four panels per page, depending on the selected template.

== Before you begin

This feature requires {page-component-title} and an instance of Grafana with at least one dashboard and panel configured.
{page-component-title} lets you create a report for any Grafana dashboard, not just those created using the https://docs.opennms.com/helm/latest/index.html[OpenNMS plugin for Grafana].

You must set Grafana as a data source by <<grafana-endpoint, configuring the Grafana endpoint>>.

If you are using the Docker image for Grafana, you must complete additional configuration steps.
Refer to Grafana's https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/image_rendering/#remote-rendering-service[Remote rendering service documentation] for more information on how to set up remote rendering.
Additional details are available on https://github.com/grafana/grafana-image-renderer/blob/master/docs/remote_rendering_using_docker.md[GitHub].

=== Configure Grafana endpoint

Configuring the Grafana endpoint sets Grafana as the data source for the dashboards from which you create PDFs.
Follow the steps below to configure the endpoint:

. Sign in to your Grafana instance.
. Choose menu:Configuration[API Keys, New API Key].
. Specify a key name and choose the *Viewer* role.
** Leave the *Time to Live* box blank so that the key never expires.
. Click *Add*.
. Copy the key to your clipboard.

. In {page-component-title}, click *Add a Grafana Endpoint*:

. In the *Endpoint Configuration* page, click the *plus* symbol (*+*) to add a new endpoint.
. Enter the required information.
. Click *Test Connection*.
. If the connection test passes, click *Create*.
** If the connection test fails, ensure that your configuration settings are valid and test the connection again.

You can now use {page-component-title} to create PDF reports of Grafana dashboards.

== Create dashboard report

Follow the steps below to create a PDF report based on a Grafana dashboard:

. In the {page-component-title} UI, choose menu:Reports[Database Reports].
. Under Report Templates, click *Grafana Dashboard Report <Xppp>*, where <Xppp> represents the number of panels per page you want to display.
. Under Report Parameters, specify the appropriate information (see the <<grafana-parameters, Parameters table>>). +
NOTE: The *Grafana Endpoint* is the data source.
Select a Grafana dashboard from the list.

. Click *Create Report*.
** You are prompted to save the report locally or open it.
The file is automatically saved to a folder on the {page-component-title} server.
It also appears in the UI in the *Persisted Reports* tab.
. To send the report to someone, click *Deliver This Report* and fill out the *Report Delivery Options*.
** If you select *Email Report*, specify the recipient's email address in the *Recipient* box.
Separate multiple recipient email addresses with a comma.
** You can also use a webhook to post the report to a specified URL.
. Click *Deliver Report*.
. To schedule the report for regular delivery, click *Schedule This Report*.
. Specify the report frequency (daily, days per week, and so on) and interval.
. Click *Schedule Report*.

Scheduled reports are displayed in the *Report Schedules* tab, where you can edit or delete them:
