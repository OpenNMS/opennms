= Maintenance Contracts Strategy Report

This is an assessment management report that can help you create and review your network device maintenance strategy.

The report includes a pie chart whose slices represent three contract states: In Contract, Expired, and No Contract.

The next chart is a stacked bar chart that groups devices by their age and shows the number of assets in each age group that have an active contract, an expired contract, or no contract.

The last chart is a stacked bar chart that groups the devices by age group.
It shows the number of devices in each group that have active contracts that are valid for the next 12 months, and devices whose contract expires in the next 12 months.

You can customize this report with a company logo (approximately 195px by 50px) in the page header.
