Text fields allow the use of the percent character `%` as a wildcard.

To match every record, enter the percent character by itself as the value for the text field.

It can also be used with other characters, for example, typing `prod%` as the value for a text field will match all records that start with "prod" in that field.

Typing `%prod%` into the text field will match any record that has the four characters "prod" anywhere in that text field.

Any string that can be used in a PostgreSQL query element that uses the LIKE predicate operator will work.
