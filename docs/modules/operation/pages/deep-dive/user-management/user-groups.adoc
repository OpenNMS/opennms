= Groups

A group is a collection of users.
Organizing users into groups helps with notifications and lets you assign a set of users to on-call roles to build more complex notification workflows.

== Create a user group

. Log in as a user with admin permissions.
. Click the gear icon at the top-right of the screen.
. Choose menu:Configure OpenNMS[Configure Users, Groups and On-Call Roles > Configure Groups].
. Specify a group name and description and click *OK*.
+
WARNING: You cannot use angle brackets (<>), single (') and double quotation marks ("), or the ampersand symbol (&) in the group name.

. Add users to the group by selecting them from the *Available Users* column and using the arrows to move them to the *Currently in Group* column.
. (Optional) Assign categories of responsibility to the group (Routers, Switches, Servers, and so on).
. (Optional) Create a <<deep-dive/user-management/user-config.adoc#ga-user-schedule, duty schedule>>.
. Click *Finish*.

NOTE: Users will receive notifications in the order in which they appear in the group.

IMPORTANT: If you delete a group, no one receives a notification that it has been deleted.
If the group is associated with a schedule, that schedule will no longer exist, and users associated with that group will no longer receive notifications previously specified in the schedule.
