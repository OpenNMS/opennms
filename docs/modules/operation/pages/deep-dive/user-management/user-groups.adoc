= Groups

Groups are collections of users.
In large systems with many users, it might be helpful to organize them into groups.

Groups may receive notifications; this is often a more convenient way to operate than configuring notifications to send to individuals.
This lets you build more complex notification workflows and makes it easier to manage recipients.
