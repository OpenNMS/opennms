[[ga-user-groups]]
= Groups

Groups in {page-component-title} are collections of users.
They may be used to organize users, such as in the case of an instance with many users or permissions sets.

You can configure groups to receive notifications.
This is often a more convenient way to maintain notification schedules, rather than configuring them to be sent to individual users.
Sending notifications to groups lets you build more complex notification workflows, and makes it easier to manage recipients.
