= On-Call Role

The on-call roles feature lets you assign a predefined link:#ga-user-schedule[duty schedule] to an existing group of users.
A common use case is to have system engineers in on-call rotations with a given schedule.

Each on-call role includes a user who is designated as a supervisor.
They receive notifications when no one is on duty to receive {page-component-title} notifications.
The supervisor must have admin privileges.
