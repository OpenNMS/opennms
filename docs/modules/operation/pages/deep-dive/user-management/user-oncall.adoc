= On-Call Roles

On-call roles let you assign a predefined xref:deep-dive/user-management/user-config.adoc#ga-user-schedule[duty schedule] to an existing group of users.
A common use case is to have system engineers in on-call rotations with a defined schedule.

For each on-call role, a user is designated as a supervisor.
They are responsible for the group of people assigned to the on-call role, and receive {page-component-title} notifications when no one else is on duty.
The supervisor must have admin privileges.
