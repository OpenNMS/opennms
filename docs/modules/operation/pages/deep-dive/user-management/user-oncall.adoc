:description: How to create on-call roles in {page-component-title} and assign pre-defined duty schedules to groups of users.

On-call roles let you assign a predefined <<deep-dive/user-management/user-config.adoc#ga-user-schedule, duty schedule>> to an existing group of users.
A common use case is to have system engineers in on-call rotations with a defined schedule.

For each on-call role, a user is designated as a supervisor.
They are responsible for the group of users assigned to the on-call role, and receive {page-component-title} notifications when no one else is on duty.
The supervisor's account must have admin privileges.

== Assign a group to an on-call role

Before you can assign a group to an on-call role, you must <<deep-dive/user-management/user-groups.adoc#ga-user-group-create, create a group>>.
After you have created the group, follow these steps to assign it to an on-call role:

. Log in as a user with admin permissions.
. Click the *gear* symbol at the top-right of the screen.
. Under OpenNMS System, click menu:Configure Users, Groups and On-Call Roles[Configure On-Call Roles].
. Click *Add New On-Call Role* and specify a name, the associated group, a user to be designated as the supervisor, and a description.
The description should be meaningful (for example, describe the team that the on-call role has been created for).
. Click *Save*.
. In the calendar, select a date and click the *add* symbol (*+*).
. Specify the user and designate an on-call schedule.
. Click *Save*.
