= Assign User Permissions

You can control user permission levels by creating and assigning security roles.
These roles regulate access to the {page-component-title} web UI and the REST API to exchange monitoring and inventory information.

In a distributed installation, Minion instances require an account that is assigned the `ROLE_MINION` security role to interact with {page-component-title}.
You can create one account for all Minions to share, or one account per Minion.

== Create custom security roles

To create a custom security role, you need to define its name and specify the permissions it will provide.
Follow the steps below to create a custom role:

. Create `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/security-roles.properties` in your OpenNMS directory.
. Add a `roles` property, and enter a comma-separated list of the custom security roles for its value:
+
.Example of a `roles` property
[source, properties]
roles=operator,stage

. Save the file.

NOTE: To define permissions associated with a custom security role, you must manually update the Spiring security application context in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/jetty-webapps/opennms/WEB-INF/applicationContext-spring-security.xml`.
