= User Maintenance

Users are entities with login accounts in the {page-component-title} system.
Ideally, each user account corresponds to only one person.

This page describes additional tasks and information related to user accounts.

== Passwords

=== Set a new password for any user

. Log in as a user with admin permissions.
. Click the *Gear* symbol at the top-right of the screen, and choose menu:Configure OpenNMS[Configure Users, Groups and On-Call Roles > Configure Users].
. Click the *Modify* icon next to an existing user and select *Reset Password*.
. Type a new password, confirm it, and click *OK*.
. Click *Finish* to apply the changes.

=== Change your password

. Log in with user name and current password.
. Choose *Change Password* from the list below your username.
. Specify your current password, then set and confirm your new password.
. Click *Submit*.
. Log out and log in with your new password.

== Delete users and groups

. Log in as a user with admin permissions.
. Click the *Gear* symbol at the top-right of the screen, and choose menu:Configure OpenNMS[Configure Users, Groups and On-Call Roles > Configure Users] or *Configure Groups*.
. Click the *Delete* symbol beside the user or group that you want to delete.
. Click *OK* to confirm deletion.

IMPORTANT: If you delete a group, no one receives a notification that it has been deleted.
If the group is associated with a schedule, that schedule will also be deleted, and users previously included in the group will no longer receive notifications that were set up in the schedule.

== Advanced configuration

{page-component-title} persists the user, password, and other detail descriptions in the `users.xml` file.
