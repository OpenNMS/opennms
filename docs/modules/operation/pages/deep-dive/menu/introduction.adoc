== Top menu

The top menu contains information and functionality that is common across all {page-component-title} pages.

| Search Bar

You can search for various things including node labels, IP addresses and actions.

| Time/Date
| The current time and date, on 2 lines.
These can be customized via OpenNMS properties using Java `java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter` patterns.
You can customize the time (top line) via the `org.opennms.ui.timeonlyformat` property; default is `HH:mm:ss 'UTC'x`.
You can customize the date (bottom line) via the `org.opennms.ui.dateonlyformat` property; default is `LLLL d, yyyy`.

See `opennms/etc/properties/opennms.properties` for an example. You should place any customizations in a `opennms/etc/opennms.properties.d/*.properties` file.

See https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html for reference.

== Legacy vs. non-legacy pages

{page-component-title} contains pages built using several different technologies.

- Java JSP - the majority of the pages
- Vaadin - a responsive technology used on pages such as BSM, Topology, Wallboards
- Vue.js - newer and future pages, built using the Vue Javascript framework as a Single Page Application

The top and side menus are built using Vue.js and the Feather Design System.

The newer Vue pages have the menus "built-in" to the Vue SPA application.

The older/legacy JSP and Vaadin pages have a Vue menu app embedded into them containing just the menu components (same components as in the SPA).


== Menu templates

The organization of the side menu is controlled by JSON menu templates and
is user-customizable.

See the xref:operation:deep-dive/menu/menu-templates.adoc[menu templates documentation].
