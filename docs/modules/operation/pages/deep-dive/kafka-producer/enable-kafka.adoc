= Enable the Kafka Producer

The Kafka Producer is disabled by default and can be enabled as follows.

First, log in to the Karaf shell of your {page-component-title} instance and configure the Kafka client settings to point to your Kafka broker.
See link:https://kafka.apache.org/10/documentation.html#producerconfigs[Producer Configs] for a complete list of available options.

.Connect to Karaf shell
[source, console]
----
ssh -p 8101 admin@localhost
----

.Configure the Kafka producer client
[source, karaf]
----
config:edit org.opennms.features.kafka.producer.client
config:property-set bootstrap.servers kafka-broker-ip:9092 <1>
config:update
----
<1> Set the Kafka broker IP by replacing the kafka-broker-ip and port you want to connect to.
    Add multiple hosts in a comma-separated list, for example, `kafka-broker-1:9092,kafka-broker-2:9092`

Next, install the `opennms-kafka-producer` feature from that same shell using:

[source, karaf]
----
feature:install opennms-kafka-producer
----

To ensure that the feature continues to be installed on subsequent restarts, add `opennms-kafka-producer` to a file in `featuresBoot.d`:
[source, console]
----
echo "opennms-kafka-producer" | sudo tee ${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/featuresBoot.d/kafka-producer.boot
----
