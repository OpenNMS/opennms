== Configure filtering

Use filtering to selectively forward events and/or alarms to the Kafka topics.

Filtering is performed using a link:https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.2.9.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/html/expressions.html[Spring SpEL expression], which is evaluated against each object to determine if it should be forwarded.
The expression must return a boolean value.

=== Enable event filtering

To enable event filtering, set the value of the `eventFilter` property to a valid SpEL expression.

[source, console]
----
$ ssh -p 8101 admin@localhost
...
admin@opennms()> config:edit org.opennms.features.kafka.producer
admin@opennms()> config:property-set eventFilter 'getUei().equals("uei.opennms.org/internal/discovery/newSuspect")'
admin@opennms()> config:update
----

In the example above, the filter is configured such that only events with the given UEI are forwarded.
Consult the source code of the `org.opennms.netmgt.xml.event.Event` class in your distribution for a complete list of available properties.

=== Enable Alarm Filtering

To enable alarm filtering, set the value of the `alarmFilter` property to a valid SpEL expression.

[source, console]
----
$ ssh -p 8101 admin@localhost
...
admin@opennms()> config:edit org.opennms.features.kafka.producer
admin@opennms()> config:property-set alarmFilter 'getTTicketId() != null'
admin@opennms()> config:update
----

In the example above, the filter is configured such that only alarms that are associated with a ticket ID are forwarded.
Consult the source code of the `org.opennms.netmgt.model.OnmsAlarm` class in your distribution for a complete list of available properties.

== Enable metric forwarding

To enable metric forwarding, set the value of the `forward.metrics` property to `true`.

WARNING: The producer's code sends a full CollectionSet per message to Kafka.
Large network equipment might have hundreds of thousands of metrics that could generate messages over the Kafka limit (1MB in size by default).
You must increase `max.request.size` at the producer level and `message.max.bytes` and `replica.fetch.max.bytes` at the broker level to avoid problems with the consumers.

[source, console]
----
$ ssh -p 8101 admin@localhost
...
admin@opennms()> config:edit org.opennms.features.kafka.producer
admin@opennms()> config:property-set forward.metrics true
admin@opennms()> config:update
----

=== Enable exclusive metric forwarding

Once metric forwarding is enabled, you can use this as the exclusive persistence strategy by setting the following system property:

[source, console]
----
echo 'org.opennms.timeseries.strategy=osgi' > "$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/opennms.properties.d/kafka-for-metrics.properties"
----

== Configure topic names

By default five topics are created i.e., `events`, `alarms`, `nodes`,`vertices`, and `edges` .
To change these, you can use:

[source, console]
----
$ ssh -p 8101 admin@localhost
...
admin@opennms()> config:edit org.opennms.features.kafka.producer
admin@opennms()> config:property-set eventTopic ""
admin@opennms()> config:property-set nodeTopic "opennms-nodes"
admin@opennms()> config:update
----

In the example above, we disable event forwarding by setting an empty topic name and change the node topic name to `opennms-nodes`.

[source, console]
----
$ ssh -p 8101 admin@localhost
...
admin@opennms()> config:edit org.opennms.features.kafka.producer
admin@opennms()> config:property-set topologyVertexTopic "opennms-bridge-vertex"
admin@opennms()> config:property-set topologyEdgeTopic "opennms-edge-vertex"
admin@opennms()> config:update
----

In the example above, we set the vertex and edge topics to be different by default.
