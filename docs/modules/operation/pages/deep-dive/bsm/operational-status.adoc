If a business service changes its operational status, an event of the type `uei.opennms.org/bsm/serviceOperationalStatusChanged` is generated.
In cases where the operational status changed from normal to a higher severity, an event of the type `uei.opennms.org/bsm/serviceProblem` is generated and has the severity of the business service.
When the business service goes back to normal, an event of the type `uei.opennms.org/bsm/serviceProblemResolved` is generated.

NOTE: Use the service problem and service problem resolved events for notifications or ticketing integration.

The log message of the events have the following information:

* Business Service Name: `businessServiceName`
* Business Service Identifier: `id`
* Previous Severity Identifier: `prevSeverityId`
* Previous Severity Label: `prevSeverityLabel`
* New Severity Identifier: `newSeverityId`
* New Severity Label: `newSeverityLabel`
