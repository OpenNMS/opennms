:description: Get an overview of how to visualize {page-component-title} monitored nodes and their relationships to each other.

A topology describes network elements (devices, services) and the connections between them.
OpenNMS can display a user-configured xref:operation:deep-dive/topology/topology.adoc#topology-map[topology map] to help visualize your network topology.
The OpenNMS xref:operation:deep-dive/topology/graphml-asset-topology-provider.adoc#asset-topology[Asset Topology Provider] lets you use http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/[GraphML] to define arbitrarily complex topologies.
Use xref:operation:deep-dive/topology/enlinkd/introduction.adoc#ga-enlinkd[Enhanced Linkd] (Enlinkd) to discover connections between nodes using data generated by various link discovery protocols and accessible via SNMP.
