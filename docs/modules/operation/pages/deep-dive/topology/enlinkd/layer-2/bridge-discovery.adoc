= Transparent Bridge Discovery

Discovering xref:deep-dive/topology/enlinkd/layer-2-discovery.adoc[Layer 2 network links] using the bridge forwarding table requires a special algorithm that is based on https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/964723.383078[_Topology Discovery for Large Ethernet Networks_].
The gathered information is used to classify links as macLinks and bridgeLinks.

== Definitions

A macLink represents a link between a workstation or server that is identified by a MAC address.
A bridgeLink represents a connection between backbone ports.

A shared segment is a connection established among workstations or servers (made up of several MAC addresses) and backbone ports (for example, devices connected via a hub).
A bridgeLink is a shared segment with only two bridge backbone ports.
A macLink is a shared segment with only one bridge port and one MAC address.

Broadcast and bridge domains are collections of shared segments, based on common sets of MAC addresses.

== Bridge domains

Discovery bridge broadcast domains are made in two steps.
The first step is data collection.
To collect the necessary information, the BridgeDiscovery collector collects the BFT and other spanning tree information.
The BFT is maintained in memory to be processed by BridgeDomainDiscovery.
BridgeDomainDiscovery runs the specified algorithm on collected BFTs, and will produce a bridge domain (or several bridge domains) based on the broadcast set of MAC addresses identified.

NOTE: BridgeDomainDiscovery does not support multi-VLAN; the bridge network model identifies a bridge for every VLAN identified.
Each VLAN has its own BFT and spanning tree.
Although discovery is run only against the main VLAN, the algorithm has to be run against all bridges and VLANs to discover a bridge topology.

Bridge domains provide no information about xref:deep-dive/topology/enlinkd/layer-3-discovery.adoc[Layer 3 links]; they produce only a Layer 2 map of the broadcast domains.
You can determine which Layer 3 interfaces map to Layer 2 nodes if your device supports the https://oidref.com/1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22[IpNetToMedia table].
You can associate a MAC address with its corresponding IP address and the associated node using this table.

== Bridge Topology Updater

The Bridge Topology Updater combines the information stored in bridge domains with the `ipnettomedia` data and the provided Bridge OnmsTopology.

Whenever possible, the Bridge Topology Updater tries to associate a MAC address to an IP address, and then to a monitored node.
It may be that the specified MAC address and IP address are not associated with a single node (for example, because there are duplicate nodes, or because the nodes support a protocol like LACP).
Because the Updater does not support LACP and other similar aggregation protocols, {page-component-title} does not resolve the node or record the association discovered as a MAC:IP relationship for a specific vertex.

NOTE: Transparent bridging is not loop-free.
If you have loops, you must enable the spanning tree protocol, which detects loops and will put some ports in a blocking state to avoid them.

You can find generic information about the bridge link discovery process in the Bridge Information box on any device's Node Detail page.
Information gathered from the supported OIDs is stored in the following database tables:

== Required SNMP MIB

To define links, {page-component-title} must perform some calculations, and the SNMP agent must support the following MIB to allow this:

[caption=]
.Supported MIB from the `Cisco-VTP` MIB
[cols="1,3,1"]
|===
| Name  | Description   | OID

| vtpVersion
| The local version of VTP.
A device reports its version capability, but not the particular version that it uses.
If the device does not support VTP, the version is `none(3)`.
| .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.46.1.1.1.0
|===

== Supported OIDs

The bridge discovery process supports the following OIDs:

.Supported OIDs from the `IP-MIB` module
[cols="1,3,1"]
|===
| Name  | Description   | OID

| ipNetToMediaIfIndex
| Interface on which the entry's equivalent is effective.
The Layer 2 interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same as identified by the value of `ifIndex`.
| .1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.1

| ipNetToMediaPhysAddress
| Media-dependent physical address.
| .1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.2

| ipNetToMediaNetAddress
| IP address that corresponds to `ipNetToMediaPhysAddress`.
| .1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.3

| ipNetToMediaType
| Mapping type.
Setting this object to `invalid(2)` invalidates its corresponding entry in the `ipNetToMediaTable`.
This effectively disassociates the entry's identified interface from its mapping.
Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that correspond to entries that are not currently in use.
Proper interpretation of such entries requires the relevant `ipNetToMediaType` object to be examined.

| dot1dStpPortState
| Current state of the port, as defined by the spanning tree protocol.
This state controls what action a port takes upon reception of a frame.
If the bridge detects a malfunctioning port, it places that port into the `broken(6)` state.
For ports that are disabled (see `dot1dStpPortEnable`), this object has a value of `disabled(1)`.
