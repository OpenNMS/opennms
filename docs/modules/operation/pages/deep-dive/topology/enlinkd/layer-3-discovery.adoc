= Layer 3 Link Discovery

Using enlinkd, it is possible to get links based on data from network routing applications.
You can use the following routing daemons to provide links-based Layer 3 information:

* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Shortest_Path_First[Open Shortest Path First] (OSPF)
* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IS-IS[Intermediate System to Intermediate System] (IS-IS)

SNMP agents that support the appropriate MIBs provide information on Layer 3 network links.
For this reason, you must have a working SNMP configuration.

The following pages describe the MIBs required to allow link discovery:
