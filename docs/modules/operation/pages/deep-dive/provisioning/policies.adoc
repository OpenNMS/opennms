= Policies

The Policy API in Provisiond lets you control the persistence of discovered IP and SNMP interface entities and node tags during the scan phase.

Edit the foreign source definition (`Edit Definition` button) of a requisition to define policies.

== Common policy parameters

The matchBehavior action is a boolean control that determines how the optional parameters will be evaluated.
Setting this parameterâ€™s value to `ALL_PARAMETERS` causes Provisiond to evaluate each optional parameter with boolean AND logic and the value `ANY_PARAMETERS` causes OR logic to be applied.

String values are assumed to be a substring match, unless the parameter is prefixed with `~` to indicate the policy should evaluate as a regular expression.

== Supported policies

For information on supported policies and how to configure them, see xref:reference:provisioning/policies.adoc[policies reference section].
