[[auto-discovery]]
= Auto Discovery

Auto discovery is the process of automatically adding nodes to {page-component-title}.
You do this through discovery, which is run either periodically on a schedule or as one-off, unscheduled operations.

Make sure you complete the tasks in <<quick-start/inventory.adoc, Step 3: Provision Inventory>> before adding nodes.

[[discovery-configure]]
== Configure discovery

Configuring discovery specifies the parameters {page-component-title} uses when scanning for nodes.

. Click the gear icon and in the *Provisioning* area choose *Configure Discovery*.
+
NOTE: To configure a discovery scan to run once, select *Run Single Discovery Scan*.

. In the *General Settings* area, accept the default scheduling options (sleeptime, retries,timeout, etc.), or set your own.
. From the *Foreign Source* list, choose the requisition to which you want to add the discovered nodes.
. If you have installed Minions, select one from the *Location* list.
. Click *Add New* to add the following:

+
* specific address (IP addresses to add)
* URLs
* IP address ranges to include
* IP address ranges to exclude

. Click *Save and Restart Discovery*.
. When the discovery is finished, navigate to the requisition (*Manage Provisioning Requisitions*) where you specified to view the nodes discovered.
. If desired, edit the nodes or delete them from the requisition, then click *Synchronize* to add them to the {page-component-title} database.
. Repeat this process for each requisition you want to provision.

[[ga-provisioning-auto-discovery-detectors]]
== Automatic discovery detectors

Auto discovery with detectors lets users specify the services to detect, in addition to ICMP ping, for the specified IP addresses to be discovered.
Discovery sends a new suspect event only when the specified detectors succeed.
A definition without any detectors will fall back to ICMP ping for discovery.

[[ga-manual-discovery]]
== Manual discovery configuration

In addition to the configuration above, there are some optional settings you can configure via `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/discovery-configuration.xml`.

.Discovery configuration parameters
[options="header" cols="1,1,3"]
|===
| Name
| Default
| Description

| packets-per-second
| 1
| Number of ICMP packets that will be generated each second.

| initial-sleep-time
| 30000 ms (30 seconds)
| The time, in milliseconds, before the discovery process begins after OpenNMS has started.
This delay allows {page-component-title} to fully start before generating new events.

| restart-sleep-time
| 86400000 ms (1 day)
| Once the discovery process finishes, the time, in milliseconds, before it will start again.

| timeout
| 2000 ms
| The amount of time, in milliseconds, that the discovery process will wait for a response from a given IP address before deciding that there is nothing there.

| retries
| 1
| The number of attempts to query a given IP address before deciding that there is nothing there.

| foreign-source
| not set
| Adds discovered nodes to the specified foreign source requisition.

| location
| Default
| The monitoring location where this discovery batch will be executed.
Only used when Minions have been deployed.

| chunk-size
| 100
| When using a monitoring locations and Minions, defines how many IP addresses are delegated to each Minion for scanning.

.Discovery range configuration parameters
[options="header" cols="1,3a"]
|===
| Tag
| Description

| specific
| Specify individual IP address(es) to discover.
May be repeated multiple times.

[source, xml]
----
<specific>ip-address</specific>
----

| include-range
| Specify a range of IP addresses to discover.
May be repeated multiple times.

[source, xml]
----
<include-range>
    <begin>start-ip-address</begin>
    <end>end-ip-address</end>
</include-range>
----

| exclude-range
| Specify a range of IP address to exclude from discovery.

[source, xml]
----
<exclude-range>
    <begin>start-ip-address</begin>
    <end>end-ip-address</end>
</exclude-range>
----

NOTE: The exclude-range tag will override addresses only in an include-range.
It will not override specific IP addresses or addresses included in a file.
There is no "specific" version of the exclude tag.
To exclude a specific IP address, use an exclude-range where the beginning and ending IP addresses are the same.

| include-url
| Specify the full path to a text file containing one IP address per line to include in discovery.
You can embed comments in this file.
Any content on a line after a `#` character is ignored.
