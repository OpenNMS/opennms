= Foreign Source Definition

The default foreign source definition serves as a template that defines the services to detect on (DNS, FTP, ICMP, and so on), the scan interval for discovery, and the policies to use when provisioning.

Policies determine entity persistence and/or set attributes on the discovered entities that control {page-component-title} management behavior.
Provisiond applies the existing default foreign source definition unless you choose to modify it.

This section describes how to edit the default foreign source definition.

== Edit detectors and set scan interval

. In the web UI, click the *Gear* symbol in the top-right of the screen.
. Choose menu:Provisioning[Manage Provisioning Requisitions > Edit Default FS].

NOTE: The screen displays the list of service detectors and a tab to view and define policies.
Provisiond scans the services in the order in which the detectors appear in the list.

** Click the *Edit* symbol to edit a service detector's parameters.
To add more parameters (retries, timeout, port, and so on), click *Add Parameter* and define its name and value.
** Click the *Move* symbol to move a service detector.
** Click the *Delete* symbol to delete a service detector.
** To undo a change, click *Reset to Default* at the top-right of the screen.
. Click *Save*.
. (Optional) Update the scan interval using one of the following:
+
* w: weeks
* d: days
* h: hours
* m: minutes
* s: seconds
* ms: milliseconds
+
For example, to prompt a scan every 6 days and 53 minutes, use `6d53m`.
Type `0` to disable automatic scanning.

. Click *Save* to save the foreign source definition.

== Create policies
