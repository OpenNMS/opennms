= Addressing Scalability

The explosive growth and density of the IT systems being deployed today to support non-traditional IP services impacts management systems like never before, and demands tremendous amounts of scalability.
The scalability of a management system is defined by its capacity to manage large numbers of entities coupled with its efficiency for managing the entities.

Today, it is not uncommon for {page-component-title} deployments to find node entities with tens of thousands of physical interfaces being reported by SNMP agents due to virtualization (virtual hosts, interfaces, and/or networks).
A monitoring system must be able to use the full capacity of every resource of its computing platform as effectively as possible.
Writing scripts or single-threaded applications is no longer sufficient to do the work required by a monitoring system at the scale of most networks today.

== Parallelization and non-blocking I/O

Squeezing out every ounce of power from a management system’s platform is absolutely required to complete all the work of a fully functional monitoring system such as {page-component-title}.
Fortunately, the hardware architecture of modern computing platforms provides multiple CPUs with multiple cores having instruction sets that include support for atomic operations.
Because of scalability demands of complex IT environments, multi-threaded monitoring solutions are now essential.

OpenNMS has stepped up to this challenge with its concurrency strategy.
This strategy is based on a technique that combines the efficiency of parallel (asynchronous) operations, traditionally used most effectively by single-threaded applications, with the power of a fully current, non-blocking, multi-threaded design.
The non-blocking component of this concurrency strategy adds greater complexity, but gives {page-component-title} substantially increased scalability.

NOTE: Java Runtimes, based on the Sun JVM, have provided implementations for processor-based atomic operations, and is the basis for {page-component-title}’s non-blocking concurrency algorithms.

=== Provisioning policies

When Provisiond scans nodes to add to the database, it may potentially spawn dozens of parallel operations to discover what services and interfaces are available.
Multiplied by the number of nodes in your environment, this can cause huge bursts in outgoing traffic from your {page-component-title} server.
To limit this impacting your network, you can define requisition policies that can control the behavior of Provisiond.
This will let you control the persistence of entity attributes to constrain monitoring behavior.

When nodes are imported or re-scanned, there is, potentially, a set of zero or more provisioning policies that are applied.
The policies are configured in the foreign source’s definition.
Auto-discovered nodes, or nodes from requisitions that don’t have a foreign source definition, use the policies configured in the default foreign source definition.

=== The default foreign source definition

The default foreign source template is contained in the libraries of the Provisioning service.
The template stored in the library is used until the {page-component-title} admin user alters the default from the Requisition Web UI.
Upon edit, this template is exported to the {page-component-title} `etc/` directory with the file name: `default-foreign-source.xml`.

Example default foreign source file:

=== Automatic rescanning

The default foreign source defines a `scan-interval` of `1d`, which causes all nodes in the requisition to be scanned daily.
You may set the scan interval using any combination of the following signifiers:

* w: Weeks
* d: Days
* h: Hours
* m: Minutes
* s: Seconds
* ms: Milliseconds

For example, to rescan every 6 days and 53 minutes, you would set the `scan-interval` to `6d 53m`.

Don't forget, for the new scan interval to take effect, you will need to import/synchronize the requisition one more time so that the change becomes active.

=== Disabling rescan

For a large number of devices, you may want to set the `scan-interval` to `0` to disable automatic rescan altogether.
{page-component-title} will not attempt to rescan the nodes in the requisition unless you trigger a manual rescan through the web UI or Provisioning REST API.

NOTE: Even if `scan-interval` is set to `0`, new nodes added to a requisition are scanned during import.
You can also disable this scan by setting `scan-interval` to `-1`.
