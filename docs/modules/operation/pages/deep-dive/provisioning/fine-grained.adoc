= Fine-Grained provisioning using provision.pl

`provision.pl` provides an example command-line interface to the provisioning-related {page-component-title} REST API endpoints.

The script has many options, but the first three optional parameters are described here:

NOTE: You can run  `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/bin/provision.pl --help` to see all of the available options.

[source, console]
----
--username (default: admin)
--password (default: admin)
--url (default: http://localhost:8980/opennms/rest)
----

== Create a new requisition

_provision.pl_ provides easy access to the requisition REST service using the `requisition` option:

[source, console]
----
${OPENNMS_HOME}/bin/provision.pl requisition customer1
----

This command will create a new, empty (containing no nodes) requisition in {page-component-title}.

The new requisition starts life in the `pending` state.
This lets you iteratively build the requisition and then later actually import the nodes in the requisition into {page-component-title}.
This handles all adds/changes/deletes at once.
So, you could be making changes all day and then at night either have a schedule in {page-component-title} that imports the group automatically or you can send a command through the REST service from an outside system to have the pending requisition imported/reimported.

You can get a list of all existing requisitions with the `list` option of the `provision.pl` script:

[source, console]
----
${OPENNMS_HOME}/bin/provision.pl list
----

=== Create a new Node

[source, console]
----
${OPENNMS_HOME}/bin/provision.pl node add customer1 1 node-a
----

This command creates a node element in the requisition `customer1` called _node-a_ using the script's `node` option.
The node's foreign-ID is _1_ but it can be any alphanumeric value as long as it is unique within the requisition.
Note the node has no interfaces or services yet.

=== Add an Interface Element to that Node

[source, console]
----
${OPENNMS_HOME}/bin/provision.pl interface add customer1 1 127.0.0.1
----

This command adds an interface element to the node element using the _interface_ option to the `provision.pl` command and it can now be seen in the pending requisition by running `provision.pl requisition list customer1`.

=== Add a Couple of Services to that Interface

[source, console]
----
${OPENNMS_HOME}/bin/provision.pl service add customer1 1 127.0.0.1 ICMP
${OPENNMS_HOME}/bin/provision.pl service add customer1 1 127.0.0.1 SNMP
----

This adds the 2 services to the specified 127.0.0.1 interface and is now in the pending requisition.

=== Set the Primary SNMP Interface

[source, console]
----
${OPENNMS_HOME}/bin/provision.pl interface set customer1 1 127.0.0.1 snmp-primary P
----

This sets the 127.0.0.1 interface to be the node's Primary SNMP interface.

=== Add a couple of Node Tags

[source, console]
----
${OPENNMS_HOME}/bin/provision.pl category add customer1 1 Routers
${OPENNMS_HOME}/bin/provision.pl category add customer1 1 Production
----

This adds the two categories to the node and is now in the pending requisition.

These categories are case-sensitive but do not have to be already defined in {page-component-title}.
They will be created on the fly during the import if they do not already exist.

=== Setting Asset Fields on a Node

[source, console]
----
${OPENNMS_HOME}/bin/provision.pl asset add customer1 1 serialnumber 9999
----

This will add value of `9999` to the asset field: _serialnumber_.

.Deploy the Import Requisition (Creating the Group)
[source, console]
----
${OPENNMS_HOME}/bin/provision.pl requisition import customer1
----

This will cause {page-component-title} Provisiond to import the pending `customer1` requisition.
The formerly pending requisition will move into the `deployed` state inside {page-component-title}.

.Deleting a Node from a Requisition

Very much the same as the add, except that a single delete command and a re-import is required.
What happens is that the audit phase is run by Provisiond and it will be determined that a node has been removed from the requisition and the node will be deleted from the DB and all services will stop activities related to it.

[source, console]
----
${OPENNMS_HOME}/bin/provision.pl node delete customer1 1 node-a
${OPENNMS_HOME}/bin/provision.pl requisition import customer1
----
This completes the life cycle of managing a node element iteratively in a import requisition.
