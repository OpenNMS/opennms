[[directed-discovery]]
= Directed Discovery

Directed discovery is the process of manually adding nodes to {page-component-title} through the requisition UI.
Two other methods for manually adding nodes (quick adding a node and manually adding an interface) are in the process of being deprecated.
We do not recommend using these features.

Make sure you complete the tasks in <<quick-start/provisioning/inventory.adoc, Step 3: Provision Inventory>> before adding nodes.

[[requisition-add-nodes]]
== Add nodes through the requisition UI

Before adding nodes to a requisition, you must <<quick-start/inventory.adoc#requisition-create, create a requisition>>.

. In the web UI, click the *Gear* symbol in the top-right of the screen.
. Choose menu:Provisioning[Manage Provisioning Requisition].
. Click the *Edit* symbol beside the requisition that you want to add nodes to.
. Click *Add Node*.
{page-component-title} auto-generates the foreign ID used to identify this node.
. Enter the appropriate information in each of the tabs:
+
[options="header", cols="1,3"]
|===
| Tab
| Settings

| Basic Information
| Required: Auto-generated foreign ID, node label +
Optional: Minion location, building, city

| <<deep-dive/service-assurance/path-outages#ga-service-assurance-path-outage, Path Outage>>
| Parent foreign source, parent foreign ID, parent node label

| Interfaces
| Interface IP addresses, description, SNMP primary, services, actions

| Assets
| Pre-defined metadata types (name, value, actions)

| Categories
| Category name for node type (for example, Routers, Production)

| Meta-Data
| Customized asset information (scope, interface, service, and so on)
|===

. Repeat for each node you want to add.
. Click *Return* to view the list of nodes you have added.
. Click *Synchronize* to provision them to the {page-component-title} database.

[[requisition-rest]]
== Add nodes via REST API

You can use the REST API to add nodes to your {page-component-title} database.
There are endpoints for both xref:development:rest/nodes.adoc[individual nodes] and xref:development:rest/requisitions.adoc[entire requisitions].

[[requisition-new-suspect]]
== Add nodes via newSuspect events

You can use the `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/bin/send-event.pl` script to generate newSuspect events to trigger the Provisiond service to check a given IP address.
Replace `ip-address` in the command below with the address you want to discover.

[source, console]
----
# ${OPENNMS_HOME}/bin/send-event.pl --interface ip-address uei.opennms.org/internal/discovery/newSuspect
----

NOTE: This adds the discovered node directly into the database.
We strongly recommend that you use <<requisition-add-nodes, requisitions>> when adding individual IP addresses, as it will be easier to manage the nodes over time.
