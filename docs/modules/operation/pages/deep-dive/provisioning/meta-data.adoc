[[ga-provisioning-meta-data]]
= MetaData assigned to nodes

A requisition can contain arbitrary link:#ga-meta-data[metadata] for each node, interface, and service it contains.
During provisioning, the metadata is copied to the model and persisted in the database.

The Requisition UI lets you edit the metadata defined in a requisition.
The edit function in the Requisition UI is limited to only edit the context called `requisition` by intention.
All other contexts are reserved for future use by other provisioning-adapters and similar applications like asset-data.

While provisioning a requisition, the metadata from the requisition is transferred to the database and assigned to the nodes, interfaces and services accordingly.

== User-defined contexts

If there is a requirement to add more contexts not managed by {page-component-title}, the context name must be prefixed by `X-`.
Any third-party software must take care to choose a context name which is unique enough to not conflict with other software.
