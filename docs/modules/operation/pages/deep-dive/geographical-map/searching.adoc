# Map Search

The search bar lets you do a simple text search, as well as searching particular fields associated with the node.

## Search fields

The search function for the geographical map uses the Search REST endpoint.
This endpoint can find nodes using any of the fields offered by the API, including the previously listed fields:

[options="header"]
[cols="3*"]
|===

| Description
| Allow Substring

| nodeId
| The ID of the node
| No

| nodeLabel
| A text description.
| Yes

| foreignSource
| The provisioned foreign source, if any.
| No

| foreignId
| The provisioned foreign ID, if any.

| severityLabel

| description

| maintContract

| category

NOTE: All searches are case-insensitive, and the search currently allows node selection using only the listed search fields.

If you want to search for exact or partial text in one of the search fields, simply type the desired text in the appropriate field.
