# Geographical Maps

OpenNMS includes a geographical map which can show nodes with address asset information on a world map, including dynamic alarm status.

The geographical map is located in the *Maps* menu or by going to the page of a node that has an address and/or longitude/latitude defined in its asset fields, and following the *View in Geographical Map* link.

## Markers and clusters

The geographical map displays each node that has an associated longitude and latitude in the database.
If a node does not have coordinates recorded, update the requisition to include address asset fields and verify the xref:deep-dive/admin/configuration/geocoder.adoc[geocoder service] is configured and enabled.

The geographical map automatically clusters nodes into groups if they are close together.
A marker with a number in it indicates a cluster and the number of nodes in it.
Hover over a cluster to show the contents of the nodes it contains.
Click on a marker to show the summary of the nodes it contains.

## Status

A node's marker displays as the color associated with the most severe alarm for that node.
A cluster's marker displays as the color of the highest severity of the nodes the marker contains.
