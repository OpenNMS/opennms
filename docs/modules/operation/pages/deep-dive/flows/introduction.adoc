= Flows

Flows are summaries of network traffic sent by network devices (switches, routers, and so on).
This information includes, but is not limited to, source and destination addresses, source and destination ports, octet count, and duration of activity.
Collecting and analyzing flows data provides a picture of network usage and helps to diagnose issues.
Persisting flows for long-term storage can aid in forensic analysis.

{page-component-title} provides the following:

* A platform to collect, persist, and visualize flows, with support for NetFlow versions 5 and 9, IPFIX, and sFlow.
* Inventory enrichment (mapping to {page-component-title} nodes).
* Application classification.
* Horizontal scaling.
* Enterprise reporting.
* Top K statistics by interface, application, host, and conversation with QoS.

See the xref:reference:telemetryd/protocols/introduction.adoc[Telemetry] section for a list of supported protocols.

This section presents a set of procedures to set up flows that progress from a basic environment to more complex:

* xref:deep-dive/flows/basic.adoc[Basic setup].
* Collect flows data in a xref:deep-dive/flows/distributed.adoc[distributed or remote network].
* Process a xref:deep-dive/flows/sentinel/sentinel.adoc[large volume of flows data].
* Use https://github.com/OpenNMS/nephron[OpenNMS Nephron] to diagnose issues with flows at scale and queries taking too long.

== How it works

At a high level, with a xref:deep-dive/flows/basic.adoc[basic setup], {page-component-title} processes flows as follows:

. Network devices send flows to either your {page-component-title} or a Minion with a xref:deep-dive/telemetryd/introduction.adoc[telemetryd] listener enabled.
. Telemetryd adapters on {page-component-title} or a Sentinel convert the flows to a canonical flow model.
. Flows are enriched:
** The xref:deep-dive/flows/classification-engine.adoc[flow support classification engine] tags flows and groups them under a name based on a set of rules.
** Metadata related to associated nodes (such as IDs and categories) are added to the flows.
. Enriched flows are persisted in Elasticsearch and/or forwarded to Kafka.
. (Optional) The OpenNMS streaming analytics tool aggregates flows and outputs them to Elasticsearch, Cortex, or Kafka.

You can access collected flows data in the following locations:

* OpenNMS plugin for Grafana dashboards:
** The "Flow Deep Dive" dashboard visualizes flows and aggregates that are stored in Elasticsearch using a flows datasource.
** The "Cortex Flow Deep Dive" dashboard visualizes aggregates that are stored in Cortex using a Prometheus datasource.
* The REST API can generate summaries and time series data from the stored flows or aggregates.
