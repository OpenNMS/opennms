= Basic Flows Setup

This section describes how to get started with flows to collect, enrich (classify), persist, and visualize flows.

== Requirements

Make sure that you have the following before you set up flows:

* A configured {page-component-title} instance.
* One or more devices that send flows visible to {page-component-title}, and that are monitored with SNMP.
* Elasticsearch cluster set up with the https://github.com/OpenNMS/elasticsearch-drift-plugin[Elasticsearch Drift plugin] installed on every Elasticsearch node.
** The Drift plugin persists and queries flows that {page-component-title} collects.
The Drift version must match the targeted Elasticsearch version.
** (Optional) Configure Elasticsearch variables like `search.max_buckets` or maximum heap size `ES-JAVA_OPTS` if the default values are not sufficient for your volume of flows or number of nodes.
** (Optional) Create a job to clean the indices so that the disk does not fill up (for example, "keep _X_ days of flows").
Filled disks are a challenging problem to address for those who are not Elasticsearch experts.
We recommend using the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/current/index.html[Elasticsearch Curator tool] to do this.
** {page-component-title} set up to monitor the Elasticsearch stack and generate an alarm if it goes down.
* The OpenNMS plugin for Grafana configured to visualize flows.
** Configure the flow and performance data sources.

== Configure {page-component-title} to communicate with Elasticsearch

{page-component-title} must be set up to communicate with Elasticsearch and persist the collected flows data in a defined directory:

. Connect to your {page-component-title} Karaf shell:
+
[source, console]
----
ssh -p 8101 admin@localhost
----

. Edit `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/org.opennms.features.flows.persistence.elastic.cfg` to configure flow persistence to use your Elasticsearch cluster:
+
[source, karaf]
----
config:edit org.opennms.features.flows.persistence.elastic
config:property-set elasticUrl http://elastic:9200
config:update
----

. (Optional) Edit or create `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/org.opennms.features.flows.persistence.elastic.cfg` and configure persistence settings:
+
[source, xml]
----
elasticUrl = http://10.10.3.218:9200 <1>
connTimeout = 30000
readTimeout = 300000
settings.index.number_of_replicas = 0
settings.index.number_of_shards=1
settings.index.refresh_interval=10s
elasticIndexStrategy=daily
----
<1> Replace with comma-separated list of Elasticsearch nodes.

** See <<deep-dive/elasticsearch/introduction.adoc#ga-elasticsearch-integration-configuration, General Elasticsearch configuration>> for a complete set of configuration options.

== Enable protocols

Follow these steps to enable one or more of the protocols that you want to handle.

NOTE: This example uses the NetFlow v5 protocol.
You can follow the same steps for any of the other flow-related protocols.

. Edit or create `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/telemetryd-configuration.xml` to enable protocols:
+
[source, xml]
----
<listener name="Netflow-5-UDP-8877" class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.telemetry.listeners.UdpListener" enabled="true">
    <parameter key="port" value="8877"/>

    <parser name="Netflow-5-Parser" class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.telemetry.protocols.netflow.parser.Netflow5UdpParser" queue="Netflow-5" />
</listener>

<queue name="Netflow-5">
    <adapter name="Netflow-5-Adapter" class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.telemetry.protocols.netflow.adapter.netflow5.Netflow5Adapter" enabled="true">
    </adapter>
</queue>
----

. Reload the daemons to apply your changes:
+
[source, console]
${OPENNMS_HOME}/bin/send-event.pl -p 'daemonName Telemetryd' uei.opennms.org/internal/reloadDaemonConfig

This configuration opens a UDP socket bound to `0.0.0.0:8877`; NetFlow v5 messages are forwarded to this socket (see <<deep-dive/admin/configuration/daemon-config-files.adoc#daemon-reload, Reload daemons by CLI>> for more information).

=== Multi-port listener

Normally, if you are monitoring multiple flow protocols, you must set up a listener on its own UDP port for each protocol.
By default, {page-component-title} allows a multi-port listener option; this monitors multiple protocols on a single UDP port (`9999`).
You can edit `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/telemetryd-configuration.xml` to change the port number and add or remove protocols.

IMPORTANT: Make sure your firewall allow list includes the ports that you have configured to receive flow data.

== Enable flows on your devices

Refer to your device's manufacturer documentation to learn more about configuring it to send flows.

NOTE: You may need to set up the flow receiver (in this case, {page-component-title}) and allow sending flows per interface on your firewall.

== Link web UI to OpenNMS plugin for Grafana

You must configure a connection to your instance of the OpenNMS plugin for Grafana to access flow-related graphs from the {page-component-title} web UI:

. Connect to your {page-component-title} Karaf shell:
+
[source, console]
ssh -p 8101 admin@localhost

. Configure the plugin settings:
+
[source, karaf]
----
config:edit org.opennms.netmgt.flows.rest
config:property-set flowGraphUrl 'http://grafana:3000/dashboard/flows?node=$nodeId&interface=$ifIndex' <1>
config:update
----
<1> This URL can also point to other tools.
It supports the `$nodeId`, `$ifIndex`, `$start`, and `$end` placeholders.

After the plugin is configured, an icon is displayed at the top-right corner of an SNMP resource graph indicating that flow data is available for the interface.
If you have trouble during or after configuration, refer to xref:deep-dive/flows/troubleshooting.adoc[].

[[kafka-forwarder-config]]
== Configure Kafka forwarder

Flows enriched with {page-component-title} node data can be forwarded to Kafka and persisted.
By default, enriched flows are stored in the `flowsDocument` topic and the payloads are encoded using https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/[Google Protocol Buffers].
See `flowdocument.proto` in the corresponding source definition for the model definitions.

To enable JSON support, set `useJson` to `true`.

Follow these steps to configure forwarding flows to Kafka:

. Enable Kafka forwarding:
+
[source, console]
----
$ ssh -p 8101 admin@localhost
...
admin@opennms()> config:edit org.opennms.features.flows.persistence.elastic
admin@opennms()> config:property-set enableForwarding true
admin@opennms()> config:update
----

. Configure the Kafka server for flows:
+
[source, console]
----
$ ssh -p 8101 admin@localhost
...
admin@opennms()> config:edit org.opennms.features.flows.persistence.kafka
admin@opennms()> config:property-set bootstrap.servers 127.0.0.1:9092
admin@opennms()> config:property-set topic opennms-flows
admin@opennms()> config:update
----

== Next steps

After you set up basic flows monitoring, you may want to do some of the following tasks:

* Classify data flows.
+
{page-component-title} resolves flows to application names.
You can create rules to override the default classifications (see xref:deep-dive/flows/classification-engine.adoc[]).

* xref:deep-dive/flows/distributed.adoc[Enable remote flows data collection].
* xref:deep-dive/flows/sentinel/sentinel.adoc[Scale to manage large volumes of flows data].
* Add https://github.com/OpenNMS/nephron[OpenNMS Nephron] for aggregation and streaming analytics.
