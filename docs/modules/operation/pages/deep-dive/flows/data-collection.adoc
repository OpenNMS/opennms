[[ga-flow-support-data-collection]]
= Data collection of flow applications

Flows are categorized in applications using the <<deep-dive/flows/classification-engine.adoc#ga-flow-support-classification-engine, Classification Engine>>.
OpenNMS supports summing up the bytesIn/bytesOut data of flow records based on these flow applications and the collection of this data.
It gives you the possibility of profiling the network throughput by an application.

NOTE: The flow classification engine includes a predefined set of rules, which defines over 6200 applications for basic communication protocols.
If you don't want to collect this kind of data, in the UI, click the gears icon in the top right and under *Flow Management* click *Manage Flow Classification*.
In the *Settings* tab, disable predefined rules.

== Configure data collection

To enable data collection for flows you need to enable the `applicationDataCollection` flag in the adapter's definition.
Furthermore, you have to ensure that a valid package definition exists inside the adapter's definition.
This may not be necessary when using Newts- or Cortex-based storage.
Note that data collection on flow applications also works without enabling thresholding on flow applications.
