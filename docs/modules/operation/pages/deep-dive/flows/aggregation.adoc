= Aggregate Flows with REST API

The flow query engine supports rendering the top _N_ metrics from pre-aggregated documents stored in Elasticsearch.
You can use these statistics to help alleviate computation load on the Elasticsearch cluster, particularly in environments with large volumes of flows (more than 10,000 per second).
To use this functionality, you must <<deep-dive/flows/basic.adoc#kafka-forwarder-config, enable the Kafka forwarder>> and set up the streaming analytics tool to process flows and persist aggregates in Elasticsearch.

Set the following properties in `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/org.opennms.features.flows.persistence.elastic.cfg` to control the query engine to use aggregated flows:

[options="autowidth"]
|===
| Property  | Description   | Default

| alwaysUseRawForQueries
| Use raw flow documents to respond to all queries instead of aggregated flows.
| true

| alwaysUseAggForQueries
| Use aggregated flow documents to respond to all queries instead of raw flows.
| false

| timeRangeDurationAggregateThresholdMs
| Queries with time range filters that have a duration greater than this value will use aggregated flows when possible.
| 120000 (2 minutes)

| timeRangeEndpointAggregateThresholdMs
| Queries with time range filters that have an endpoint that is older than this value will use aggregated flows when possible.
