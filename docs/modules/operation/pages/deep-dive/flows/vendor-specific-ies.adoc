= Vendor-specific Information Elements
:description: Learn how to include vendor-specific information elements in {page-component-title} to collect additional data from your devices.

NetFlow (v5/v9) allow the collection of pre-defined flow-related metrics.
In addition to that IPFIX also supports vendor-specific "Information Elements" beside the pre-defined ones (see https://www.iana.org/assignments/ipfix/ipfix.xhtml#ipfix-information-elements).
{page-component-title} supports the collection of vendor-specific IPFIX data.

== Adding Vendor-specific Definitions
Any additional definitions need to be placed in the directory `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/ipfix.d`.
The following example shows a definition for a vendor "Foobar-Company" with a Private Enterprise Number (PEN) of "1234".
After the starting `scope` definition the file just lists all defined information elements including their names, their identfiers and their data-types.
See https://www.iana.org/assignments/ipfix/ipfix.xhtml#ipfix-information-element-data-types for available data-types.

        <name>myMetricB</name>
        <dataType>unsigned64</dataType>
    </element>
</ipfix-elements>

In order for the newly placed files to become active, {page-component-title} needs to be restarted.
When Minions are in use, the parser are executed on the Minions.
Thus, the additional definitions also need to placed in the Minions' `ipfix.d` directories.
