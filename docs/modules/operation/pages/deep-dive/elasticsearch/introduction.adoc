= Elasticsearch Integration

{page-component-title} can persist/forward certain data to Elasticsearch.
The following sections describe the configuration possibilities as well as the available features.
Internally, all Elasticsearch integrations use the https://github.com/searchbox-io/Jest[Jest library] to access the Elasticsearch REST interface.

[[ga-elasticsearch-integration-configuration]]
== Configuration

The location of the configuration file depends on the feature.

For flows, find it in `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/org.opennms.features.flows.persistence.elastic.cfg`.
You can set the following properties:

|circuitbreaker.failure_rate_threshold_in_percent
|The failure rate threshold in percentage above which the CircuitBreaker should trip open and start short-circuiting calls.
|99

|circuitbreaker.wait_in_open_state_milliseconds
|The time, in milliseconds, that the CircuitBreaker should wait before transitioning from open to half-open.
|60000

|circuitbreaker.ring_buffer_size_in_closed.state
|The size of the ring buffer when the CircuitBreaker is closed.
The ring buffer needs to be filled before the failure rate is calculated.
|100

|circuitbreaker.ring_buffer_size_in_half_open_state
|The size of the ring buffer when the CircuitBreaker is half-open.
This ring buffer is used when the breaker transitions from open to half-open to decide whether the circuit is healthy or not.
|10

TIP: If a configuration management tool is used, the properties file can be created and used as the startup configuration.

NOTE: If credentials are provided, preemptive authorization is used for all defined Elasticsearch nodes.

.Configuration example to access Elasticsearch
[source, properties]
----
elasticUrl=http://elastic:9200
elasticIndexStrategy=daily
globalElasticUser=elastic
globalElasticPassword=changeme
----

== Credentials

It is possible to define credentials for each Elasticsearch node individually.
Credentials for each node must be stored in `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/elastic-credentials.xml`.

.Custom credentials
[source, xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<elastic-credentials>
    <credentials url="http://localhost:9200" username="ulf" password="ulf" />
    <credentials url="https://10.10.0.1:9333" username="ulf" password="flu" />
</elastic-credentials>
----

NOTE: Credentials are globally defined and will be used by all features that connect to the specified URLs.

== Circuit breaker

When Elasticsearch is unavailable, a circuit breaker is used to reduce the number of blocked threads.
After a defined number of errors, requests to the server will not be sent for the defined period of time.
Instead, the requests are cancelled immediately with an error.
To configure the circuit breaker, use the parameters that begin with `circuitbreaker.`.
