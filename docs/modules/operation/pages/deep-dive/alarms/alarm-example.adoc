An alarm is generated on the first occurrence of a `service-down` problem:

.`service-down` alarm created

Click the number displayed in the *Count* column to display the corresponding events and their details:

.Alarm displaying service down event
image::alarms/single_alarm_2.png["Alarm Details page displaying a service down event"]

The alarm clears immediately when service is restored, and no alarm is created when the service returns to a normal state:

.Alarm cleared
image::alarms/single_alarm_3.png["Alarm List displaying one cleared alarm and its log message"]

.Service down and service restored events
image::alarms/single_alarm_4.png["Alarm Details page displaying one service down event and one service restored event"]

If the problem occurs again, the events are reduced into the existing alarm.
The alarm's count is updated to reflect the new activity:

.Reduced alarm
image::alarms/single_alarm_5.png["Alarm List displaying one alarm with a count of 2"]

.List of events
image::alarms/single_alarm_6.png["Detailed event list page displaying two service down events and one service restored event, all of which are components of the same alarm"]

The alarm once again clears immediately when service is restored:

.Reduced alarm cleared
image::alarms/single_alarm_7.png["Alarm List displaying one cleared alarm with a count of 2, and its log message"]

Note that the alarm's count does not increment when the problem is resolved.
