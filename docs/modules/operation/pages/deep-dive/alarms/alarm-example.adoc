:description: Example of alarm lifecycle and lifetime rules in OpenNMS Horizon/Meridian.

The following is an example of the alarm lifecycle based on a `nodeLostService` event.

== Lifecycle example

A new `nodeLostService` event is received and creates a new alarm.

.New alarm visible in outstanding alarm list

Clicking the number displayed in the *Count* column displays the corresponding events and their details.

.Event list showing events related to the alarm

The alarm clears automatically when service is restored, based on a `nodeRegainedService` event.

.Alarm cleared

.Service down and service restored events

If the problem occurs again, the events are reduced into the existing alarm.
The alarm's count is updated to reflect the new activity.

.Alarm reopened with an increase in the `count` value

.Event list showing events related to the alarm
image::alarms/single_alarm_6.png["Detailed event list page displaying two service down events and one service restored event, all of which are components of the same alarm"]

The alarm once again clears immediately when service is restored.

.Reduced alarm cleared

Note that the alarm's count only increments on events with a severity of Warning or greater.

.Service down and restored events

== Alarm lifetime rules

Alarms are deleted from the {page-component-title} database after a set amount of time.
This lifetime can be configured via Drools rules in the `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/alarmd/drools-rules.d/alarmd.drl` file.
The default alarm lifetimes:

[options="autowidth"]
|===
| Alarm State | Deletion Delay

| Cleared and Unacknowledged
| 5 minutes

| Cleared and Acknowledged
| 1 day

| Active and Unacknowledged
| 3 days

| All other alarms
| 8 days
|===

These delays are based on the last event time, and will restart the counter if a new problem event is reduced into the same alarm.
