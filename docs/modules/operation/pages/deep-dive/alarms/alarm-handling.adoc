== Alarm handling

The following interactions with alarms are possible.

=== Acknowledgment

PICTURES MISSING

An alarm can be acknowledged by an user.
The alarm will be moved out from `Alarm(s) outstanding` into `Alarm(s) acknowledged` view.
By doing this other OpenNMS users can notice, that someone is aware of this alarm.

NOTE: A manually acknowledged alarm that was cleared automatically by its clear event needs also unacknowledged manually to disappear.

=== Clearing

PICTURES MISSING

Clearing an oustanding or acknowledged alarm means "mark it as resolved".
The cleared alarm will disappear within a defined cycle.

NOTE: If the alarm was created by a threshold configuration the alarm will appear again, if the defined metric is still or again matching the threshold configurations.
An alarm based on a `nodeLostService` event won't appear again. To keep track on those `outage alarms` check the outages list.

=== Escalation

PICTURES MISSING

An alarm always has the same <<deep-dive/events/event-configuration.adoc#severities, severities>> like its underlaying event.
If an alarm gets escalated, the alarm's <<deep-dive/events/event-configuration.adoc#severities, severity>> gets increased one level.

=== Notes

{page-component-title} creates alarms for issues in the network.
Alarm notes let you assign comments to a specific alarm, or to a whole class of alarms, and share that information with other people on your team.

You can add two types of notes to existing alarms or alarm classes:

* *Sticky Memo:* A user-defined note for a specific instance of an alarm.
Deleting the alarm also deletes any associated sticky memos.
* *Journal Memo:* A user-defined note for a class of alarms, based on the resolved reduction key.
Journal memos are shown for all alarms that match a specific reduction key.
Deleting an individual alarm does not remove the journal memo.

You must click *Clear* on an alarm with an associated journal memo to remove it.

Symbols on the Alarm List Summary and Alarm List Detail pages indicate if individual alarms have sticky or journal memos associated.
