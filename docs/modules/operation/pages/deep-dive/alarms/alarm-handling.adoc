= Alarm handling

The following are ways you can interact with alarms.

== Acknowledgment

PICTURES MISSING

Users can acknowledge alarms.
The alarm will be moved out from `Alarm(s) outstanding` into the `Alarm(s) acknowledged` view.
Doing this lets other {page-component-title} users see that someone is aware of the alarm.

NOTE: A manually acknowledged alarm that was cleared automatically by its clear event needs also unacknowledged manually to disappear.

== Clearing

PICTURES MISSING

Clearing an outstanding or acknowledged alarm means "mark it as resolved".
The cleared alarm will disappear within a defined cycle.

NOTE: Alarms created by a threshold configuration will appear again if the defined metric still matches the threshold configurations or matches it again.
An alarm based on a `nodeLostService` event won't appear again.
To keep track of those `outage alarms`, check the outages list.

== Escalation

PICTURES MISSING

An alarm always has the same <<deep-dive/events/event-configuration.adoc#severities, severities>> as its underlaying event.
If an alarm gets escalated, the alarm's <<deep-dive/events/event-configuration.adoc#severities, severity>> increases one level.

== Alarm notes

{page-component-title} creates alarms for issues in the network.
Alarm notes let you assign comments to a specific alarm, or to a whole class of alarms, and share that information with other people on your team.

You can add two types of notes to existing alarms or alarm classes:

* *Sticky Memo:* A user-defined note for a specific instance of an alarm.
Deleting the alarm also deletes any associated sticky memos.
* *Journal Memo:* A user-defined note for a class of alarms, based on the resolved reduction key.
Journal memos are shown for all alarms that match a specific reduction key.
Deleting an individual alarm does not remove the journal memo.

You must click *Clear* on an alarm with an associated journal memo to remove the memo.

Symbols on the Alarm List Summary and Alarm List Detail pages indicate if individual alarms have associated sticky or journal memos.
