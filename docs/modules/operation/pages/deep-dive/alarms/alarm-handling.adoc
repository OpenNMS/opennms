:description: Ways to manage alarms in {page-component-title}: acknowledgement, clearing, escalation, related events, alarm note, and advanced alarm handling.

The following are ways you can interact with alarms.

== Acknowledgment

Users can acknowledge alarms to let other {page-component-title} users see that someone is aware of the alarm.
The alarm will be moved out from `Alarm(s) outstanding` into the `Alarm(s) acknowledged` view.
Acknowledged alarms will also be hidden from the "Nodes with Pending Problems" section of the home page.

== Clearing

Clearing an alarm means "mark it as resolved".

== Escalation

By default, an alarm has the same <<deep-dive/events/event-configuration.adoc#severities, severity>> as its most recent event.
If an alarm gets escalated, the alarm's severity increases by one level.

== Related events

{page-component-title} correlates possible related events into alarms based on events with the same <<deep-dive/alarms/configuring-alarms#ga-reduction-key, reduction key>>.
You can use the related events section of the alarm details view to see which events have been grouped into the alarm.

== Alarm notes

Alarm notes let you assign comments to a specific alarm, or to a whole class of alarms, and share that information with other people on your team.

You can add two types of notes to existing alarms or alarm classes:

Sticky Memo:: A user-defined note for a specific instance of an alarm.
Deleting the alarm also deletes any associated sticky memos.
Journal Memo:: A user-defined note for a class of alarms, based on the resolved reduction key.
Journal memos are shown for all alarms that match a specific reduction key.
Deleting an individual alarm does not remove the journal memo.
You must click *Clear* on an alarm with an associated journal memo to remove the memo.

The Alarm List Summary and Alarm List Detail pages will have a symbol to indicate if individual alarms have associated sticky or journal memos.

== Advanced alarm handling

In addition to the manual actions described above, it is possible to automate alarm handling with the use of https://www.drools.org/[Drools] scripts.
There is a default rule set for handling alarm cleanup in the `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/alarmd/drools-rules.d/` directory.
You can find some additional examples in the `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/examples/alarmd/drools-rules.d/` directory.
