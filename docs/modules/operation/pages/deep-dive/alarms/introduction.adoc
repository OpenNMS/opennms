= Alarms

{page-component-title} uses a network's managed entities, their resources, the services they provide, and any applications that they host to monitor problem states.

While events carry immutable problem state attributes such as <<deep-dive/events/event-configuration.adoc#severities, severities>>, alarms indicate problems in the network (see xref:deep-dive/bsm/introduction.adoc[]) and carry changeable attributes such as acknowledgment, clearing, escalation, or temporary and persisted notes.

Thus alarms are always based on events that are <<deep-dive/alarms/configuring-alarms.adoc#ga-configure-alarms, configured>> to create additional alarms.
