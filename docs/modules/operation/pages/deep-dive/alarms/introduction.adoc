= Alarms

{page-component-title} uses a network's managed entities, their resources, the services they provide, and any applications that they host to monitor problem states.

While events carry immutable problem state attributes such as severity, alarms indicate problems in the network (see xref:deep-dive/bsm/introduction.adoc[]) and carry changeable attributes such as acknowledgment.

== Single alarm tracking problem states

An alarm is instantiated on the first occurrence of a `service-down` problem:

.`service-down` alarm created
image::alarms/single_alarm_1.png["Alarm List displaying one alarm of minor severity"]

Click the number displayed in the *Count* column to display the corresponding events and their details:

.Alarm displaying service down event
image::alarms/single_alarm_2.png["Alarm Details page displaying a service down event"]

The alarm is cleared immediately when service is restored, and no alarm is created when the service returns to a normal state:

.Alarm cleared
image::alarms/single_alarm_3.png["Alarm List displaying one cleared alarm and its log message"]

.Service down and service restored events
image::alarms/single_alarm_4.png["Alarm Details page displaying one service down event and one service restored event"]

If the problem occurs again, the events are reduced into the existing alarm.
The alarm's count is updated to reflect the new activity:

.Reduced alarm
image::alarms/single_alarm_5.png["Alarm List displaying one alarm with a count of 2"]

.List of events
image::alarms/single_alarm_6.png["Detailed event list page displaying two service down events and one service restored event, all of which are members of the same alarm"]

The alarm is once again cleared immediately when service is restored:

.Reduced alarm cleared
image::alarms/single_alarm_7.png["Alarm List displaying one cleared alarm with a count of 2, and its log message"]

Note that the alarm's count does not increment when the problem is resolved.

.Service down and restored events
