{page-component-title} creates alarms for issues in the network.
Alarm notes let you assign comments to a specific alarm, or to a whole class of alarms, and share that information with other people on your team.

You can add two types of notes to existing alarms or alarm classes:

* *Sticky Memo:* A user-defined note for a specific instance of an alarm.
Deleting the alarm also deletes any associated sticky memos.
* *Journal Memo:* A user-defined note for a class of alarms, based on the resolved reduction key.
Journal memos are shown for all alarms that match a specific reduction key.
Deleting an individual alarm does not remove the journal memo.

You must click *Clear* on an alarm with an associated journal memo to remove it.

Symbols on the Alarm List Summary and Alarm List Detail pages indicate if individual alarms have sticky or journal memos associated.
