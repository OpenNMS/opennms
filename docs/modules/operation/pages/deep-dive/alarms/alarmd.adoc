= Alarm Service Daemon

Alarmd, the Alarm Service Daemon, processes events representing problems in the network.
It either instantiates a new alarm for tracking a problem's state or reduces a recurring Event of an existing problem into the same Alarm.
(Also known as alarm de-duplication.)

https://www.drools.org/[Drools] in Alarmd provide a more robust infrastructure for the effective management of workflow and problem states in the network.
Find these business rules in the `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/alarmd/drools-rules.d/` folder.
