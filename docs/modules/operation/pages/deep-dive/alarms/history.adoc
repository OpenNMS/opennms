= Alarm History

The alarm history feature integrates with Elasticsearch to provide long-term storage and maintain a history of alarm state changes.
When it is enabled, alarms are indexed in Elasticsearch when they are created, deleted, or when any interesting fields (for example, Ticket State, Sticky Memo) on the alarm are updated.
Alarms are indexed so that operators can answer the following questions:

* What were all the state changes of a particular alarm?
* What was the last known state of an alarm at a given point in time?
* Which alarms were present (not deleted) on the system at a given point in time?
* Which alarms are currently present on the system?

A simple REST API also lets you evaluate the results, verify stored data, and provide examples on how to query the data.

NOTE: This feature requires Elasticsearch 7.0+.

== Alarm history indexing

When alarms are created, a document that includes all alarm fields and additional details on related objects (for example, the node), is pushed to Elasticsearch.
To avoid pushing a new document every time a new event is reduced to an existing alarm, documents are pushed only when at least one of the following conditions is met:

* A document has not recently been pushed for the alarm (see `alarmReindexDurationMs`).
* The severity of the alarm has changed.
* The alarm has been acknowledged or unacknowledged.
* The associated sticky or journal memos have changed.
* The state of the associated ticket has changed.
* The alarm has been associated with or removed from a situation.
* A related alarm has been added to or removed from a situation.

NOTE: To change this behavior and push a new document for every change, set `indexAllUpdates` to `true`.

When alarms are deleted, {page-component-title} pushes a new document containing the alarm ID, reduction key, and deletion time to Elasticsearch.

Follow these steps to enable alarm history indexing:

. Log in to your {page-component-title} instance's Karaf shell.
. Configure the Elasticsearch client settings to point to your Elasticsearch cluster (see <<deep-dive/elasticsearch/introduction.adoc#ga-elasticsearch-integration-configuration, Elasticsearch integration configuration>> for a complete list of available options):
+
[source, karaf]
----
$ ssh -p 8101 admin@localhost
...
admin@opennms()> config:edit org.opennms.features.alarms.history.elastic
admin@opennms()> config:property-set elasticUrl http://es:9200
admin@opennms()> config:update
----

** (Optional) To set the feature to start automatically upon future service starts, add `opennms-alarm-history-elastic` to `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/featuresBoot.d/alarm.boot`.
If the file does not exist, create it.
** (Optional) To start the feature immediately, run the `feature:install opennms-alarm-history-elastic` command in the Karaf shell.
