:description: Get an overview of how {page-component-title} uses Elasticsearch to persist historical alarm data.

Alarms are deleted from the {page-component-title} database as they clear or become stale.
If you would like to keep an historical record of alarm data, you can enable the alarm history feature to provide long-term storage and maintain a history of alarm state changes in Elasticsearch.

For more information, see xref:deep-dive/elasticsearch/features/alarm-history.adoc#ga-alarm-history[Alarm History].
