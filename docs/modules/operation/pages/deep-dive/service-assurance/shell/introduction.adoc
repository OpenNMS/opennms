A number of Karaf Shell commands are available to help administer and diagnose issues related to service assurance.

To use the commands, log into the Karaf Shell on your system using:

[source]

ssh -p 8101 admin@localhost

NOTE: The Karaf shell uses the same credentials as the web interface.
      Users must be associated with the `ADMIN` role to access the shell.

IMPORTANT: To keep the session open while performing long-running tasks without any user input add `-o ServerAliveInterval=10` to your ssh command.
