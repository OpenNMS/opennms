= Detect Short Service Outages

By default, the monitoring interval for a service is five minutes.
To detect short service outages, like those caused by automatic network rerouting, use the configurable downtime model.
The downtime model lets you reduce the monitoring interval to every 30 seconds for five minutes on a detected service outage.
If the service comes back within five minutes, a shorter outage is documented and the impact on service availability can be less than five minutes.

The following figure shows two outages.
The first shows a short outage that was detected as up after 90 seconds.
The second outage is not currently resolved: the monitor has not detected an available service and was not available within the first five minutes (10 times 30 second polling).

The scheduler changed the polling interval back to five minutes.

----
<downtime interval="30000" begin="0" end="300000" /><!-- 30s, 0, 5m --><1>
<downtime interval="300000" begin="300000" end="43200000" /><!-- 5m, 5m, 12h --><2>
<downtime interval="600000" begin="43200000" end="432000000" /><!-- 10m, 12h, 5d --><3>
<downtime interval="3600000" begin="432000000" delete="never"/><!-- 1h, 5d --><4>
----
<1> From 0 seconds after an outage is detected until five minutes, set the polling interval to 30 seconds.
<2> After five minutes of an ongoing outage until 12 hours, set the polling interval to 5 minutes.
<3> After 12 hours of an ongoing outage until five days, set the polling interval to 10 minutes.
<4> After five days of an ongoing outage, the service will be polled only once a hour and we do not delete services.

The last downtime interval can have an attribute `delete` that lets you influence the service lifecycle.
It defines the intended behavior if a service doesn't come back online after the specified interval.
The following downtime attributes for `delete` can be used:

[options="header, autowidth"]
