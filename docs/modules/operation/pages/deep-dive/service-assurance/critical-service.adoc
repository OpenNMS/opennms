= Improve Monitoring Efficiency

Monitoring services on an IP network can be resource-intensive, especially in cases where many of the services are not available.
When a service is offline or unreachable, the monitoring system spends most of its time waiting for retries and timeouts.

To improve efficiency, {page-component-title} deems all services on an interface to be down if the critical service is down.
{page-component-title} uses ICMP as the critical service by default.

The following image shows how to use critical services to generate these events:

.Service assurance with pollerd in {page-component-title}
image::service-assurance/03_node-outage-correlation.png[]

<1> Critical services are all up on the node and just a `nodeLostService` is sent.
<2> Critical service of one of many IP interfaces is down and `interfaceDown` is sent.
All other services are not tested and no events are sent.
The services are assumed to be unreachable.
<3> All critical services on the node are down and just a `nodeDown` is sent.
All other services on the other IP interfaces are not tested and no events are sent.
These services are assumed as unreachable.

{page-component-title} uses the critical service to correlate outages from services to a `nodeDown` or `interfaceDown` event.
This is a global configuration option of pollerd, defined in `poller-configuration.xml`.
The {page-component-title} default configuration enables this behavior.

.Critical service configuration in pollerd
[source, xml]
----
<poller-configuration threads="30"
                      pathOutageEnabled="false"
                      serviceUnresponsiveEnabled="false">

<node-outage status="on" <1>
      pollAllIfNoCriticalServiceDefined="true"> <2>
      <critical-service name="ICMP" /> <3>
</node-outage>
----
<1> Allow node outage correlation based on a critical service.
<2> (Optional) For nodes without a critical service, this option controls the polling behavior during a node outage.
If set to `true`, all services will be polled.
If set to `false`, the first service in the package that exists on the node will be polled until service is restored.
When service is restored, polling will resume for all services.
<3> Define the critical service for node outage correlation.
