= Improve Monitoring Efficiency

Monitoring services on an IP network can be resource-intensive, especially in cases where many of the services are not available.
When a service is offline or unreachable, the monitoring system spends most of its time waiting for retries and timeouts.
To improve efficiency, {page-component-title} deems all services on an interface to be down if the critical service is down.
{page-component-title} uses ICMP as the critical service by default.

The following image shows how to use critical services to generate these events:

image::service-assurance/03_node-outage-correlation.png["Example of three nodes experiencing varying critical service events", 800]

. All critical services are up on the node; only a `nodeLostService` event is sent.
. A critical service on one of many IP interfaces is down; an `interfaceDown` event is sent.
All other services are not tested, and no other events are sent.
These services are assumed to be unreachable.
. All critical services on the node are down, and only a `nodeDown` event is sent.
All other services on the other IP interfaces are not tested, and no events are sent.
These services are assumed to be unreachable.

{page-component-title} uses critical services to correlate outages to a `nodeDown` or `interfaceDown` event.
This is a global configuration setting for pollerd, and is defined in `poller-configuration.xml`.
It is enabled by default.

----

<1> Allow node outage correlation based on a critical service.
<2> (Optional) For nodes without a critical service, this option controls the polling behavior during a node outage.
If set to `true`, all services will be polled.
If set to `false`, the first service in the package that exists on the node will be polled until service is restored.
When service is restored, polling will resume for all services.
<3> Define the critical service for node outage correlation.
