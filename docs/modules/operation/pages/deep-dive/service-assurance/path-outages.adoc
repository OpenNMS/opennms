= Use Path Outages to Suppress Notifications
:description: How to use path outages to suppress notifications with {page-component-title}.

An outage on a central network component can cause a large number of node outages.
You can use path outages to suppress notifications based on how nodes depend on each other in the network, as outlined in a critical path definition.
The critical path must be configured from the network perspective of the monitoring system.
By default, the path outage feature is disabled and must be enabled in `poller-configuration.xml`.

The following image shows a sample network topology:

From the perspective of the monitoring system, a router named `default-gw-01` is on the critical path to reach two networks.
If `default-gw-01` is down, it is not possible to reach any node in the two networks behind it.
In this case, an administrator should receive only one notification for `default-gw-01`; notifications for the other nodes behind it should not be generated.
Building this configuration in {page-component-title} requires the following information:

* *Parent Foreign Source:* the foreign source where the parent node is defined.
* *Parent Foreign ID:* the foreign ID of the parent node this node depends on.
* *IP Interface:* the primary IP interface is used as the critical IP.

In this example, we have created all nodes in a requisition named `Network-ACME` and we use the node label value as the foreign ID:

. Click the *gear* symbol in the top-right of the screen.
. Under Provisioning, click *Manage Provisioning Requisitions*.
. Click *Edit* beside the requisition that you want to modify.
. Click *Edit* beside the node that you want to modify.
. Navigate to the *Path Outage* tab, and configure the network path using the following parameters:

IMPORTANT: The primary IP interface is selected as the critical IP.
In this example, it is important that the IP interface on `default-gw-01` in the network `192.168.1.0/24` is set as the primary interface.
The IP interface in the network `172.23.42.0/24` on `default-gw-02` is also set as a primary interface.
