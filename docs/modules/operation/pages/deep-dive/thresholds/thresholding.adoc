= Thresholding

A threshold lets you define limits against network performance metrics of a managed entity to trigger an event when a value goes above or below the specified limit.

* High
* Low
* Absolute value
* Relative change

== How thresholding works in {page-component-title}

{page-component-title} uses collectors to implement data collection for a particular protocol or family of protocols (SNMP, JMX, HTTP, XML/JSON, WS-Management/WinRM, JDBC).
You can specify configuration for a particular collector in a collection package: essentially the set of instructions that drives the behavior of the collector.

The Collectd daemon gathers and stores performance data from these collectors.
This is the data against which {page-component-title} applies thresholds.
Thresholds trigger events when a specified threshold value is met.
You can further create notifications and alarms for threshold events.

{page-component-title} uses four thresholding algorithms to trigger an event.
See xref:quick-start/thresholding.adoc[Set Up a Threshold] in the Quick Start section for more information.

{page-component-title} applies these threshold algorithms against any performance data (telemetry) collected by <<deep-dive/performance-data-collection/introduction.adoc#ga-performance-mgmt,collectd>> or pushed to <<deep-dive/telemetryd/introduction.adoc#ga-telemetryd, telemetryd>>.
This includes, but is not limited to, metrics such as CPU load, bandwidth, disk space, and so on.

For information on setting and configuring collectors, collectd, and the  _collectd-configuration.xml_ file, see <<deep-dive/performance-data-collection/introduction.adoc#performance-management, Performance Management>>.
