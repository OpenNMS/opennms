= Thresholding Tasks

For information on how to create a basic or expression-based threshold, see xref:quick-start/thresholding.adoc[] in the Quick Start section.
This section describes related thresholding tasks.

[[ga-threshold-metadata]]
== Use metadata in a threshold

Metadata in expression-based thresholds can streamline threshold creation.
The <<deep-dive/meta-data.adoc#ga-meta-data-dsl, Metadata DSL>> (domain specific language) lets you use patterns in an expression, whereby the metadata is replaced with a corresponding value during the collection process.
A single expression can behave differently based on the node that it is tested against.

During evaluation of an expression, the following scopes are available:

* Node metadata
* Interface metadata
* Service metadata

Metadata is also supported in the value, re-arm, and trigger fields for Single-DS and expression-based thresholds.
For more information on metadata and how to define it, see <<deep-dive/meta-data.adoc#metadata-overview, Metadata>>.

=== Example

This procedure uses metadata to trigger an event when the number of logged-in users exceeds one.
The expression is in the form `${context:key|context_fallback:key_fallback|...|default}`.

Before using metadata in a threshold, you need to add the metadata context pairâ€”-in this case, a requisition key called `userLimit` (see <<deep-dive/meta-data.adoc#ga-metadata-webui, Adding metadata through the web UI>>).

Follow these steps to create the expression-based threshold:

. Click the *gear* symbol in the top-right of the screen.
. Under Performance Measurement, click *Configure Thresholds*.
. Click *Edit* beside the `netsnmp` group.
. Click *Create New Expression-based Threshold*.
. Fill in the following information:
+
* Type: High
* Expression: `hrSystemNumUsers / ${requisition:userLimit|1}`
* Datasource type: Node
* Value: 1
* Rearm: 1
* Description: Too many logged-in users

. Click *Save*.

This expression will trigger an event when the number of logged-in users exceeds one.

== Confirm that you are collecting metrics

Before creating a threshold, you should make sure that you are collecting the metric against which you want to threshold:

. Choose menu:Reports[Resource Graphs].
. Select one of the listed resources.
. Under SNMP Node Data, select menu:Node-Level Performance Data[Graph Selection].
. Scroll to find the graph for the metric you want to threshold.
+
You can click the *binoculars* symbol to display only that graph.

[[datasource-determine]]
== Determine the data source

Creating a threshold requires the name of the data source generating the metrics on which you want to threshold.
Data source names for the SNMP protocol appear in `etc/snmp-graph.properties.d`.

To determine the name of the data source, navigate to the *Resource Graphs* screen:

. Choose menu:Reports[Resource Graphs].
. Select one of the listed resources.
. Under SNMP Node Data, select menu:Node-Level Performance Data[Graph Selection].
. Scroll through the graphs to find the title of the graph that displays the metric on which you want to threshold.
For example, "Number of Processes" or "System Uptime":
+
.{page-component-title} performance data metric graphs
image::thresholding/Graphs.png["Two example performance data metric graphs: one displays system uptime, and one displays the number of active processes over time"]

. Go to `etc/snmp-graph.properties.d` and search for the title of the graph (for example, "System Uptime").
. Note the name of the data source, and type it in the *Datasource* box when you xref:quick-start/thresholding.adoc[create your threshold].
