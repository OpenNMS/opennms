= Dashboard

In Network Operations Centers (NOCs), an overview of issues occurring in the network is important.
This information is often presented in customized dashboards, as appropriate for the monitored environment.
A dashboard is an at-a-glance overview of the network, and it is often used as an entry point for more detailed diagnosis of issues using data provided by {page-component-title}.

Large networks have people (operators) who have different responsibilities, according to its monitoring needs.
Each dashboard should show only the information pertaining to a specific monitoring context.
Operators need to customize and filter information on the dashboard to create focused data sets.

TIP: You can hide the upper navigation bar on any page by adding `?quiet=true;` to the end of any {page-component-title} URL.
This is useful when viewing dashboards on a large monitor or TV screen.

[[ga-dashboard-components]]
== Components

The dashboard is comprised of five components:

* *Surveillance view:* lets you model a monitoring context for the dashboard.
+
You can reduce visible information by selecting rows, columns, and cells to focus on, limiting the data to sift through.
The rest of the dashboard updates dynamically.

* *Alarms:* displays unacknowledged alarms whose severity is higher than Normal (1).
Any alarms shown here should be escalated by an operator.
* *Notifications:* displays outstanding and unacknowledged notifications that have been sent to engineers.
* *Outages:* displays all ongoing network outages.
* *Resource graphs* displays time series reports for performance diagnosis.

[[ga-dashboard-surveillance-view]]
=== Surveillance view

The surveillance view component has multiple functions:

* It lets you model the network monitoring context.
* It shows service and node outages in a compact matrix view.
* It lets you limit the information displayed in the rest of the dashboard dynamically by manually selecting rows, columns, and cells.

By default, all entries in a surveillance view are selected.
For more information on configuring the surveillance view component, see <<deep-dive/admin/webui/surveillance-view.adoc#ga-surveillance-view, Surveillance View>>.

[[ga-dashboard-alarms]]
=== Alarms

The alarms component displays an overview of all unacknowledged alarms whose severity is higher than Normal (1).
It sorts alarms from most to least recent, and lets you scroll through the last 100 alarms.

Acknowledged alarms are removed from the operator's responsibility and, therefore, the alarms component.

The following information is shown in the component:

.An alarms component displaying three alarms--two of Minor severity, and one of Warning severity
image::dashboard/03_dashboard-alarms.png[]

1. *Node:* the label of the node associated with the alarm.
2. *Severity:* severity of the alarm.
3. *UEI:* the alarm's UEI.
4. *Count:* the number of alarms deduplicated by the alarm's reduction key.
5. *Last Time:* the time at which the most recent alarm was generated.
6. *Log Msg:* the log message from the alarm's event definition.

[[ga-dashboard-notifications]]
=== Notifications

The notifications component shows outstanding and unacknowledged notifications.
It sorts notifications from most to least recent, and lets you scroll through the last 100 notifications.

Notifications are used to inform people on a duty schedule of issues in the monitored network, and to force action to fix or reconfigure systems immediately.
In {page-component-title}, it is possible to acknowledge notifications to designate someone as working on a specific issue.

A dashboard should show outstanding notifications in the NOC.
This provides an overview of the monitored network and gives an opportunity for intervention.

The following information is shown in the component:

.A notifications component displaying three notifications
image::dashboard/04_dashboard-notifications.png[]

1. *Node:* the label of the node associated with the notification.
2. *Service:* the name of the service associated with the notification.
3. *Message:* the log message associated with the notification.
4. *Sent Time:* time when the notification was sent.
5. *Responder:* name of the user who acknowledged the notification.
6. *Respond Time:* the time when the Responder acknowledged the notification.

[[ga-dashboard-node-status]]
=== Outages

The outages component shows all ongoing network outages.
An acknowledged alarm doesn't necessarily mean that an outage has been solved; for this reason, the outages component works alongside the alarms component to provide a holistic overview of the network.

.An outages component displaying five nodes and their availability stats
image::dashboard/05_dashboard-outages.png[]

1. *Node:* the label of the node.
2. *Current Outages:* the number of services on the node experiencing outages.
The number of outages is listed out of the total number of monitored services (for example, "3 of 3 services are affected").
3. *24 Hour Availability:* the availability of all node services, calculated across the last 24 hours.

[[ga-dashboard-resource-graph-viewer]]
=== Resource graphs

The resource graphs component shows time series reports across a defined time range.
It also lets you navigate to time series data reports, providing a quick entry point from which to diagnose performance issues.

The component filters nodes based on the surveillance view context.
It shows only one graph report at a time, and lets you navigate sequentially through the data.

[[ga-dashboard-advanced-configuration]]
== Advanced configuration

The surveillance view component lets you model views for different monitoring contexts.
Using it, you can create a special view as an example for network or server operators.
The dashboard displays only _one_ configured <<deep-dive/admin/webui/surveillance-view.adoc#ga-surveillance-view, surveillance view>>.
You can, however, let certain users define their surveillance view to fit their requirements by mapping their account to a configured surveillance view component.

Any nodes selected in the surveillance view are also aware of the https://opennms.discourse.group/t/user-restriction-filters-webacls/1021[User Restriction Filter].
If you have a group of users who should see only a subset of nodes, the surveillance view will filter the data appropriately.

The dashboard is designed to focus, and therefore also restrict, a user's view of monitored devices.
To do this, a new user role was added.
It restricts them to viewing only the dashboard, if that is the administrator's intent.

[[ga-dashboard-dashboard-role]]
=== The Dashboard role

The following example shows how the Dashboard role (`ROLE_PROVISION`) can be used.
Here, the `drv4doe` user is assigned the Dashboard role:

. xref:operation:quick-start/users.adoc#create-user[Create a new user] named `drv4doe`.
The user represents a router and switch jockey.
. Add the `ROLE_PROVISION` role to the account through the web UI or by manually editing `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/users.xml`:
** Via the web UI:
... Click the *Gear* symbol at the top-right of the screen.
... Under OpenNMS System, click *Configure Users, Groups and On-Call Roles*.
... On the Users and Groups screen, click *Configure Users*.
... Click *Modify* beside the `drv4doe` account.
... In the Security Roles section, select `ROLE_PROVISION` in the *Available Roles* list and click *Add >>* to add it to the account.
... Click *Finish* at the bottom of the screen to update the account.
** Add the following code to `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/users.xml`:
+
[source, xml]
----
<user>
    <user-id>drv4doe</user-id>
    <full-name>dashboard User</full-name>
    <password salt="true">6FOip6hgZsUwDhdzdPUVV5UhkSxdbZTlq8M5LXWG5586eDPa7BFizirjXEfV/srK</password>
    <role>ROLE_DASHBOARD</role>
</user>
----

. Define the surveillance view for `drv4doe` in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/surveillance-view.xml`:
+
[source, xml]
----

        </column-def>
      </columns>
    </view>
  </views>
</surveillance-view-configuration>
----

When a user logs in using the `drv4doe` account, they are taken directly to the dashboard page and presented with a custom dashboard based on the `drv4doe` surveillance view definition.
All other users will see the default dashboard.

NOTE: After logging in, the person using the `drv4doe` account is taken directly to the dashboard page.
They are not allowed to navigate to other {page-component-title} URLs.
If they try to do so, they are presented with an Access Denied error.

=== Anonymous dashboards

You can modify the security framework configuration files to allow access to one or more dashboards without requiring a user to log in:

. Create users and configure surveillance views as shown in <<#ga-dashboard-dashboard-role, The Dashboard role>>.
For this example, we will create two dashboards and two users, one of each named `dashboard1` and the others named `dashboard2`.
. Edit `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/jetty-webapps/opennms/WEB-INF/web.xml` to create aliases for the dashboards.
Add the following code just before the first `<servlet-mapping>` tag:
+
[source, xml]
----
    <servlet>
        <servlet-name>dashboard1</servlet-name>
        <jsp-file>/dashboard.jsp</jsp-file>
    </servlet>

    <servlet>
        <servlet-name>dashboard2</servlet-name>
        <jsp-file>/dashboard.jsp</jsp-file>
    </servlet>
----
+
Add the following code just before the first `<error-page>` tag:
+
[source, xml]
----
    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>dashboard1</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/dashboard1</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>

    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>dashboard2</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/dashboard2</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>
----
+
Add the following code after the final `<filter-mapping>` tag:
+
[source, xml]
----
  <filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>AddRefreshHeader-120</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/dashboard.jsp</url-pattern>
  </filter-mapping>
  <filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>AddRefreshHeader-120</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/dashboard1</url-pattern>
  </filter-mapping>
  <filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>AddRefreshHeader-120</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/dashboard2</url-pattern>
  </filter-mapping>
----

. Edit `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/jetty-webapps/opennms/WEB-INF/applicationContext-acegi-security.xml` to enable anonymous authentication for the `/dashboard1` and `/dashboard2` aliases:
+
Add the following code in the `<bean id="filterChainProxy" ...>` block, after the entry for `/rss.jsp*`:
+
[source, xml]
----
  <bean id="filterChainProxy" class="org.acegisecurity.util.FilterChainProxy">
    <property name="filterInvocationDefinitionSource">
      <value>
        CONVERT_URL_TO_LOWERCASE_BEFORE_COMPARISON
        PATTERN_TYPE_APACHE_ANT
        /rss.jsp*=httpSessionContextIntegrationFilter,logoutFilter,authenticationProcessingFilter,basicProcessingFilter,securityContextHolderAwareRequestFilter,anonymousProcessingFilter,basicExceptionTranslationFilter,filterInvocationInterceptor
        /dashboard1*=httpSessionContextIntegrationFilter,logoutFilter,securityContextHolderAwareRequestFilter,dash1AnonymousProcessingFilter,filterInvocationInterceptor
        /dashboard2*=httpSessionContextIntegrationFilter,logoutFilter,securityContextHolderAwareRequestFilter,dash2AnonymousProcessingFilter,filterInvocationInterceptor
        /**=httpSessionContextIntegrationFilter,logoutFilter,authenticationProcessingFilter,basicProcessingFilter,securityContextHolderAwareRequestFilter,anonymousProcessingFilter,exceptionTranslationFilter,filterInvocationInterceptor

...
----
+
Add the following code in the `<bean id="filterInvocationInterceptor" ...>` block, after the entry for `/dashboard.jsp`:
+
[source, xml]
----
  <bean id="filterInvocationInterceptor" class="org.acegisecurity.intercept.web.FilterSecurityInterceptor">

...

        /frontpage.htm=ROLE_USER,ROLE_DASHBOARD
        /dashboard.jsp=ROLE_USER,ROLE_DASHBOARD
        /dashboard1=ROLE_USER,ROLE_DASHBOARD
        /dashboard2=ROLE_USER,ROLE_DASHBOARD
        /gwt.js=ROLE_USER,ROLE_DASHBOARD

...
----
+
Add a new `AnonymousProcessingFilter` instance for each alias near the bottom of the file:
+
[source, xml]
----
  <!-- Set the anonymous username to dashboard1 so the dashboard page can match it to a surveillance view of the same name. -->
  <bean id="dash1AnonymousProcessingFilter" class="org.acegisecurity.providers.anonymous.AnonymousProcessingFilter">
    <property name="key"><value>foobar</value></property>
    <property name="userAttribute"><value>dashboard1,ROLE_DASHBOARD</value></property>
  </bean>

  <bean id="dash2AnonymousProcessingFilter" class="org.acegisecurity.providers.anonymous.AnonymousProcessingFilter">
    <property name="key"><value>foobar</value></property>
    <property name="userAttribute"><value>dashboard2,ROLE_DASHBOARD</value></property>
  </bean>
----

. Restart {page-component-title}.
. Navigate to `\http://hostname/opennms/dashboard1` to test your settings.
You should be able to see a dashboard without logging in.

NOTE: There is no way to view another dashboard without closing the browser, or deleting the `JSESSIONID` cookie.

TIP: If you accidentally click a link that requires full user privileges, you will see a login form.
Once you are directed to the login form, you cannot return to the anonymous dashboard without restarting the browser.
If this bothers you, you can set the `ROLE_USER` role alongside the `ROLE_DASHBOARD` role in the `userAttribute` property definition.
Note, however, that setting this role provides full user access to anonymous browsers.
