= Operator Board

An operator board helps Network Operations Centers (NOCs) visualize network monitoring information.
You can use and arrange customizable dashlets to display different types of information (alarms, availability maps, and so on) on the board.
You can also create multiple ops boards and customize them for different user groups.

There are two visualization modes in which you can display dashlets:

* *Ops Panel:* displays multiple dashlets on one screen.
Useful for displaying information in a centralized location (for example, on a NOC operator's workstation).
+

* *Ops Board:* displays one dashlet at a time, in rotation.
Useful for displaying a variety of information that users can view independently (for example, on a wall-mounted screen in a NOC).

== Configuration

You must have admin permissions to create and configure ops boards.
After you create an ops board, you can specify how the information will be visualized (as a panel or a board).

Follow these steps to create a new operator board:

. Click the *gear* symbol at the top-right of the screen.
. Under Additional Tools, click *Ops Board Configuration*.
. Click the *plus* symbol (*+*) beside the Overview tab, type a name for the new ops board, and click *Save*.
. Click *Add Dashlet*, select a dashlet from the *Dashlet* list, and configure its settings:
** *Title:* dashlet name to display in the ops board.
** *Priority:* how often the dashlet displays in the rotation.
Priority 1 is the highest, meaning it appears the most often.
** *Duration:* how long the dashlet displays in the rotation, in seconds.
** *Boost-Priority:* change the dashlet's priority if it is in an alert state.
This setting is optional, and is not available for all dashlets.
** *Boost-Duration:* change the display duration if the dashlet is in an alert state.
This setting is optional, and is not available for all dashlets.
** (Optional) Click *Properties* to configure additional settings (alarm severity, chart type, and so on).
. Click the *up arrow* and *down arrow* symbols to change the dashlet's order.
This affects its rotation order in the Ops Board view, or its position in the Ops Panel view.
. Click *Preview* in the dashlet settings area to preview the dashlet.
. Click *Preview* beside the operator board name to preview the board and all of its dashlets.

The board's configuration is automatically saved.
To view the ops board, click menu:Dashboards[Ops Board] in the menu bar.
Depending on the visualization you want to see, select either *Ops Panel* or *Ops Board*.

== Dashlets

Each dashlet visualizes specific information (for example, unacknowledged alarms).
The following sections describe each dashlet and its available configuration parameters.

To filter the information displayed in a dashlet, configure it using a generic <<deep-dive/admin/webui/opsboard/criteria-builder.adoc#webui-opsboard-criteria-builder, criteria builder>>.
