= Search

{page-component-title} provides two ways to search in the web UI: through the search bar and the *Search* view.

== Search bar

The search bar uses keywords to return both nodes that match the keyword(s) and a list of actions you can perform that relate to the keyword.
Press the btn:[Shift] key twice or click in the search bar to activate it for typing.

Note that the search results for nodes also display any nodes with xref:deep-dive/meta-data.adoc#metadata-overview[metadata] that match the keyword, such as a label, location, admin user, and so on.
For example, if you search for 'foo' and get a node match of 'foobar', the result displays no metadata.
However, if you search for 'foo' and a match is found in a node's metadata customkey='somefoo' (even if the node name does not contain 'foo'), the result displays the name of the node (for example, 'node1') and the 'foo' metadata associated with it.
See xref:search-customize[Customize search results] below for more information.

Click on a node to navigate to the node's page.
Click on one of the actions to navigate to the screen that lets you complete the specified action.
For example, clicking on *Edit Requisition 'Test'* takes you to the screen where you can edit the requisition named 'Test'.

== Search view

The Search view provides a number of search options for nodes.
Click *Search* on the main menu to access the *Search* view.

=== Quick-search links

Click on the following links to quickly search for the associated information:

* All nodes
* All nodes and their interfaces
* All nodes with asset info

=== Name search

Search by name is a case-insensitive, inclusive search.
For example, searching on `serv` finds any of `serv`, `Service`, `Reserved`, `NTSERV`, `UserVortex`, and so on.
Use the underscore character as a single-character wildcard.
Use the percent character as a multiple-character wildcard.

=== IP address search

Searching by IP address uses a flexible search format that lets you separate the four or eight (in the case of IPv6) fields of an IP address into specific searches.
An asterisk (`*`) in place of any octet matches any value for that octet.
Separate two numbers by a dash (`-`) to indicate a range.
Use a comma for list demarcation.

For example, the following search fields are all valid and each creates the same result set: all IP addresses from 192.168.0.0 through 192.168.255.255:

* 192.168.\*.*
* 192.168.0-255.0-255
* 192.168.0,1,2,3-255.*
* 2001:6a8:3c80:8000-8fff:*:*:*:*
* fc00,fe80:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

=== System or interface search

A system/interface attribute search finds nodes with systems or interfaces that match a given search string.
The "contains" modifier provides a case-insensitive, inclusive search similar to the "name containing" search described above.
The "equals" modifier requires the search to find an exact match.

=== Location search

Select the location or service to search for from the appropriate drop-down menu.

=== MAC address search
Case-insensitive, partial string match to find interfaces with hardware (MAC) addresses that match the search string.
For example, to find all interfaces with a specified manufacturer's code, enter the first six characters of the MAC address.
Octet separators (dash or colon) are optional.

=== Foreign service name search
Case-insensitive, inclusive search on the foreign service name.
Use the underscore character as a single-character wildcard.
Use the percent character as a multiple-character wildcard.

=== Flows search
Find nodes with or without flows data.

=== Enhanced Linkd topology search

Find nodes with CDP/LLDP data that match the given search string.

=== Category or field search
Search for nodes that have assets associated with a particular category or field.
The field search includes a list of fields and a text box to match a value.
The field search is case-insensitive and inclusive.
Use the underscore character as a single-character wildcard.
Use the percent character as a multiple-character wildcard.

== Customize search results

Customize search results to show additional metadata in the search results pop up.
Create a new file in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/opennms.properties.d/` and specify a value for `org.opennms.netmgt.search.info`, to pick additional metadata fields to display.

This example displays the node's sys-contact and the associated department:

`org.opennms.netmgt.search.info=${node:sys-contact} (Department: ${asset:department})`
