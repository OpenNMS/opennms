[[heatmap]]
= Heatmap

The heatmap visualization displays either unacknowledged alarms or ongoing outages, depending on its configuration.
You can apply each of these visualizations to categories, foreign sources, or node services.

The size of an entity is calculated by counting the services inside of the entity.
Thus, a node with fewer services is displayed as a smaller box than one with more services.

The heatmap feature is deactivated by default, and is configured in `opennms.properties`.

For example, use `^(?!XY).*` to filter out entities with names starting with `XY`.
