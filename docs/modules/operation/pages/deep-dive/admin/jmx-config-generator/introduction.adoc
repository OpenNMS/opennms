= JMX Configuration Generator

{page-component-title} implements the JMX protocol to collect long-term performance data for Java applications.
There are a wide variety of metrics available, and administrators have to select which information to collect.

The JMX Configuration Generator Tools are built to help generate valid complex JMX data collection configuration and RRD graph definitions for {page-component-title}.
They are available as both a xref:deep-dive/admin/jmx-config-generator/cli.adoc[CLI-based] and xref:deep-dive/admin/jmx-config-generator/webui.adoc[web-based] utility.
