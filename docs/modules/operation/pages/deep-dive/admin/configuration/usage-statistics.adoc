= Usage Statistics

By default, the Usage Statistics module collects anonymous usage statistics.
It publishes them to an aggregated list of statistics from all participating users (https://stats.opennms.com/[OpenNMS Usage Report]) when {page-component-title} starts, and every 24 hours after.

(For information on usage statistics collection and user consent, see xref:deployment:core/getting-started.adoc#usage-statistics[usage statistics].)

{page-component-title} collects and publishes a number of data points, including the following:

* System ID (a randomly generated, universally unique identifier (UUID)).
* {page-component-title} release.
* {page-component-title} version.
* OS architecture.
* OS name.
* OS version.
* Number of available processors (CPU).
* Amount of free physical memory.
* Total amount of physical memory.
* Number of alarms in the `alarms` table.
* Number of situations in the `alarms` table.
* Number of events in the `events` table.
* Number of IP interfaces in the `ipinterface` table.
* Number of nodes in the `node` table.
* Number of nodes, grouped by system OID.
* Number of locations.
* Number of Minions.
* Number of provisiond requisitions, by scheme.
* Provisiond thread pool sizes.
* List of enabled and disabled services.
* List of installed features in Karaf.
* Global notification enablement status.
* Number of destination paths.
* Number of on-call roles.
* Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) name.
* RDBMS version.
* Number of pollerd tasks completed.
* Number of event logs processed.
* Number of core flows persisted.
* Number of Newts samples inserted.

. Click the *gear* symbol at the top-right of the page.
. Under Additional Tools, click *Usage Statistics Sharing*.

The usage statistics collection settings are updated.

[[uninstall-data-collection]]
== Uninstall or block usage statistics collection

While we encourage users who are concerned about usage statistics collection to simply <<disable-data-collection, disable>> statistics sharing, we recognize that some organizations may want to remove the usage statistics collection feature entirely.

Opting out preserves the usage statistics for local consumption and troubleshooting purposes, but removes the sharing aspect of usage statistics collection.

IMPORTANT: Uninstalling or blocking this feature eliminates the possibility of viewing the collected usage statistics locally.
These statistics tend to be extremely helpful when seeking support.
