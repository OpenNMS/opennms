:description: Learn how to configure the News Feed service in {page-component-title}.

The News Feed is a panel on the main {page-component-title} page which displays information from the OpenNMS website RSS news feed.
This can help keep users informed of the latest OpenNMS and {page-component-title} news.

The {page-component-title} server makes REST queries to the https://www.opennms.com/feed/[OpenNMS RSS feed] to get the latest feed data.

This feature is enabled by default, but can be disabled using the configuration below.
Disabling will remove the panel from the front page and the server will no longer make queries for the feed.

If you would like to change the feed settings, you can set the following options in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/opennms.properties.d/feed.properties`.

[options="autowidth"]
