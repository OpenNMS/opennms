= Configure System Properties

Properties files let you configure {page-component-title}'s global behavior settings.
They are stored in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc`.

NOTE: Your configuration settings can also affect the Java virtual machine on which {page-component-title} runs.

After making configuration changes, you must restart {page-component-title} for them to take effect.

The evaluation priorities for Java system properties are as follows:

. Those set via the Java command line (for example, in `opennms.conf` via `ADDITIONAL_MANAGER_OPTIONS`).
. `opennms.properties.d/*.properties`.
. `opennms.properties`.
. `libraries.properties`.
. `rrd-configuration.properties`.
. `bootstrap.properties`.

TIP: To avoid conflicts with customized configurations, you can add all custom properties to one or more files in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/opennms.properties.d/`.
We recommend that you do not modify default OpenNMS configurations; instead, you can create files with your customized property settings in `opennms.properties.d/`.
