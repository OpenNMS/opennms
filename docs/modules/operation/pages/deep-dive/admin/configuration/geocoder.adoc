= Geocoder Service

The geocoder service resolves geolocation information in {page-component-title}.
{page-component-title} also supports several external geocoder services.
By default, geolocation resolution is disabled.

When enabled, geolocation is performed based on the presence of address-related asset fields assigned to a node.
The geocoder service runs only against nodes that are missing latitude and longitude fields, but that do not have street address fields.
See xref:deep-dive/provisioning/directed-discovery.adoc[Provisioning] for more information on defining asset fields in a requisition.

Resolved coordinates are stored in the database as node asset fields, but the geocoder service does not update requisitions.

== Address-based geocoding

To enable or configure the geocoder service, use the web-based configuration tool:

. In the {page-component-title} web UI, click the *gear* symbol in the top-right of the page.
. Under Provisioning, select *Configure Geocoder Service*.
. You can use one of three geocoder services: Google, MapQuest, or Nominatim.
To enable one, toggle the corresponding switch to *On*.
. Navigate to the appropriate tab and configure the service:
** *Google:*
... Choose whether to authenticate using the `clientId` and signature.
... Type the API key and configure the timeout.
... Choose whether to use the system proxy.
** *MapQuest:*
... Type the API key.
... Choose whether to use the system proxy.
** *Nominatim:*
... Type your email address.
... (Optional) Configure the user agent and referer.
... Read and accept the terms of use.
... Choose whether to use the system proxy.
. Click *Save*.

NOTE: If you would prefer to manually edit the configuration files, you can set the active geocoder service via the `activeGeocoderId` property in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/org.opennms.features.geocoder.cfg`.

=== Google

The Google geocoder API is a service that provides geocoding and reverse geocoding of addresses.
The Google geocoder API requires at least an `apiKey` or a `clientId` and `signature`.
For more details, see the https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key[official Google documentation].

=== MapQuest

The MapQuest geocoder lets {page-component-title} associate latitude and longitude coordinates with an actual address (geolocation).

To use MapQuest, you must register and sign up for an API key.
For more details, refer to the https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/geocoding-api/[official MapQuest documentation].

=== Nominatim

https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim[Nominatim] is a tool that searches OpenStreetMap data and creates synthetic addresses for OpenStreetMap points.
It lets {page-component-title} look up coordinates for a given address.
For more information, see the https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/[official Nominatim documentation].

IMPORTANT: Be sure to check the https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/[Nominatim Usage Policy] before using the geocoder service.

== IP-based geocoding

An alternative to the geocoder service is the xref:reference:provisioning/adapters/geoip.adoc[GeoIP provisioning adapter].
This adapter can look up coordinates based on IP address, and will update the node's requisition definition, bypassing the need for the geocoder service to determine location based on address.
