= Secure Credentials Vault

The secure credentials vault lets you encrypt credentials that {page-component-title} uses.
It stores them in the Java keystore (JKS) format.

The secure credentials vault is enabled by default.

== Configure password

You can configure a custom password for the secure credentials vault by editing `org.opennms.features.scv.jceks.key` in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/opennms.properties.d/svc.properties`.

IMPORTANT: You cannot change the secure credentials vault password after credentials have been stored.
You must delete `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/scv.jce` and manually re-add any credentials if you want to change the password after the file has been created.

The secure credentials vault keystore file is located in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/scv.jce`.

== Store credentials

Entries in the SCV are identified by aliases.
For each alias, you can store a username, a password, and a set of key-value pair attributes.

To access or add credentials, click menu:Info[Secure Credentials Vault] in the top menu bar.

== Access entries
