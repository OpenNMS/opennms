= SSL Client Connections

You must set up the Java truststore to establish SSL connections from {page-component-title} to monitored nodes.
The truststore should contain all of the certificates that {page-component-title} needs to verify trust when making connections during polling or collecting.

{page-component-title} will use the system truststore associated with your Java installation.
Because any changes to that truststore may be overwritten if you upgrade or reinstall Java, you can specify a custom truststore to use.

== Set up Java truststore

Follow these steps to set up a Java truststore:

.Import a certificate
[source, console]
----
keytool \
  -import \ <1>
  -v \ <2>
  -trustcacerts \ <3>
  -alias localhost \ <4>
  -file localhost.cert \ <5>
  -keystore ${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/trust-store.jks <6>
----
<1> Define a certificate or a certificate chain import.
<2> Use verbose output.
<3> Trust certificates from `cacerts`.
<4> The alias for the certificate to import (for example, the common name).
<5> The certificate to import.
<6> The location of the Java truststore.
If this file doesn't exist, it will be created.

If you create a new Java truststore, you must provide a password to protect it.
If you update an existing Java truststore, type the password that you chose when you first created the truststore.

== (Optional) Download existing public certificate

Use the following command to download an existing public certificate, if necessary:

[source, console]
----
openssl \
  s_client \ <1>
  -showcerts \ <2>
  -connect localhost:443 \ <3>
  -servername localhost \ <4>
  < /dev/null \ <5>
  > localhost.cert <6>
----
<1> Use SSL/TLS client functionality of `openssl`.
<2> Show all certificates in the chain.
<3> PORT:HOST to connect to (for example, `localhost:443`).
<4> Optional.
If you are serving multiple certificates under one IP address, you may define a server name; otherwise, the `ip of localhost`:PORT certificate is returned, which may not match the requested server name (`mail.domain.com`, `opennms.domain.com`, `dns.domain.com`).
<5> No input.
<6> Where to store the certificate.

== Configure {page-component-title} to use the Java truststore

To set up {page-component-title} to use the defined Java truststore, you must set the applicable `javax.net.ssl.trustStore*` properties.
Edit or create `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/opennms.properties.d/ssl.properties` and add the following properties:

[source, properties]
----
javax.net.ssl.trustStore=${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/trust-store.jks
javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=change-me
----

For more details on the Java built-in SSL system properties, see <<ga-ssl-client-debugging, Debugging/Properties>>.

NOTE: Each time you modify the Java truststore, you must restart {page-component-title} services for the changes to take effect.

== Differences between Java truststore and keystore

The Java truststore determines whether a remote connection should be trusted--in other words, whether a remote party is who it claims to be.
It serves as a client use case.

The Java keystore decides which authentication credentials should be sent to the remote host for authentication during an SSL handshake.
It serves as a server use case.

For more information, see the https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/security/java-secure-socket-extension-jsse-reference-guide.html[JSSE Reference Guide].

== Debugging/Properties

If you encounter issues while using SSL, it might be useful to enable debug logging.
You could also use one of the built-in Java system properties to configure SSL:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| System Property Name  | Description

| javax.net.ssl.keyStore
| Location of the keystore file that contains the application process's certificate and private key.

| javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword
| Password to access the private key from the keystore file specified by `javax.net.ssl.keyStore`.
This password is used twice: once to unlock the keystore file (store password), and once to decrypt the private key stored in the keystore (key password).
The JSSE framework requires these passwords to be identical.

| javax.net.ssl.keyStoreType
| (Optional) Keystore type.
Defaults to `jks`.

| javax.net.ssl.trustStore
| Location of the truststore file that contains the CA certificates that the application process trusts.
If this property does not specify a truststore location, the Java implementation searches for and uses a keystore file from the following locations, in order: +
* `$\{JAVA_HOME}/lib/security/jssecacerts`
* `$\{JAVA_HOME}/lib/security/cacerts`

| javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword
| Password to unlock the truststore file.

| javax.net.ssl.trustStoreType
| (Optional) Truststore type.
Defaults to `jks`.

| javax.net.debug
| (Optional) Controls logging for the SSL/TLS layer.
To enable, set this property to `ssl`. +
For more details about possible values, see https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/security/java-secure-socket-extension-jsse-reference-guide.html#GUID-31B7E142-B874-46E9-8DD0-4E18EC0EB2CF[debugging utilities] in the official Oracle documentation.
