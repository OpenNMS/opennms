= System Properties

Properties files let you configure the global behavior of {page-component-title}.
Configuration can also affect the Java virtual machine under which {page-component-title} runs.
You must restart {page-component-title} for changes to take effect.
Access the configuration files in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc`.

The priority for Java system properties is as follows:

. Those set via the _Java_ command line i.e., in `opennms.conf` via `ADDITIONAL_MANAGER_OPTIONS`
. `opennms.properties.d/*.properties` +
Files in this directory are loaded alphabetically.
. `opennms.properties`
. `libraries.properties`
. `rrd-configuration.properties`
. `bootstrap.properties`


TIP: To avoid conflicts with customized configurations, you can add all custom properties to one or more files in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/opennms.properties.d/`.
We recommend not to modify default OpenNMS properties.
Create dedicated files with your customized properties in `opennms.properties.d/`.
