When using RRD/JRB storage, data is stored in the file system using a RRD-type strategy.
With this "round robin" storage, data is kept in aggregated time buckets, with the latest bucket overwriting the oldest bucket, and multiple collection within the time period for a bucket will cause the data to be consolidated based on the type of bucket.

The aggregation buckets are defined in various config files based on a `<RRD>...</RRD>` block.

   <rra>RRA:MIN:0.5:288:366</rra><6>
</rrd>
----
<1> Step of 300 seconds (5 minutes) per bucket.
This value should match the interval of the services in the package.
<2> Store the average of 1 bucket for 2016 buckets.
5-minute averages kept for 7 days.
<3> Store the average of 12 buckets for 1488 buckets.
1-hour average kept for 62 days.
<4> Store the average of 288 buckets for 366 buckets.
1-day average kept for 366 days.
<5> Store the maximum of 288 buckets for 366 buckets.
1-day max kept for 366 days.
<6> Store the minimum of 288 buckets for 366 buckets.
1-day min kept for 366 days.

IMPORTANT: If the RRD definition is modified after data has been collected, you must manually delete the existing RRD/JRB files on disk so they can be recreated with the updated definition.

When using another storage strategy, such as Newts, Cortex, or other integration, all collected data points are persisted without aggregation.
These points will be kept until the configured TTL expires.
These storage strategies will ignore any defined `<RRA>` definitions in favor of the TTL value.
