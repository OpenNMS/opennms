:description: Overview of performance data collection using collectd in {page-component-title}.

{page-component-title} uses xref:reference:daemons/daemon-config-files/collectd.adoc[collectd] to collect performance data.
Collectd schedules data collection on network entities using management agents and protocol-specific collectors (SNMP, HTTPS, JMX, and so on).
Each collector has its own associated configuration file that defines its parameters.
