= Collectors

Collectd uses collectors to gather and store performance metrics via specific agents and protocols.
This section includes information for the collector types available in {page-component-title}.

Understanding xref:operation:deep-dive/performance-data-collection/resource-types.adoc[resource types] helps when editing collector-specific configuration files.

== Supported collectors

For information on supported collectors and how to configure them, see xref:operation:deep-dive/performance-data-collection/introduction.adoc[Performance Management].
