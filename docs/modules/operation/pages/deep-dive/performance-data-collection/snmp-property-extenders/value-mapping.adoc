= Value Mapping Property Extender

The Value Mapping property extender provides a mechanism that works as a lookup table for converting collected values to a different data type.
This lets you do things such as map an enumerated set of string values to a corresponding set of integer values, or the other way around.
The resulting values are then persisted as time-series data to track state changes over time.

== Configuration

The Value Mapping property extender expects zero or more parameters.
There are currently three parameters with fixed names:

[options="autowidth"]
|===
| Name  | Description   | Default Value

3+| *Required*

| source-attribute
| The alias name of the property used for the value lookup.
| _Blank_

| target-type
| The target data-type (for example, `gauge`).
| string

3+| *Optional*

| default-value
| The value for entries that cannot be matched.
| _Blank_
|===

The remaining parameters are named for the input values, and their values represent the output values.
