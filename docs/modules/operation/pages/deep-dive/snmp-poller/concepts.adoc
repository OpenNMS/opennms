= SNMP Interface Poller

{page-component-title} can monitor the status of an SNMP interface that is not directly monitored by a <<deep-dive/service-assurance/introduction.adoc#ga-service-assurance, Service Assurance>> monitor.

IMPORTANT: This feature is not related to SNMP polling and collecting.
This optional feature is used to generate events when device interfaces have a change in their `ifAdminStatus` or `ifOperStatus` states.
If you want to collect performance data from SNMP interfaces, please see the xref:operation:deep-dive/performance-data-collection/introduction.adoc[Performance Management] section.

The SNMP interface poller is a separate service that uses a node interface, typically a management interface, to get administration and operational status for other interfaces on the device.
On a configurable time interval, a SNMP GET request is made for two specific objects in an `ifEntry` of the `ifTable` defined in the `IF-MIB`.
See <<snmp-int-poll-oid, OID information>> at the end of this document for details.

After retrieving these values the service will:

* Update the values of `ifAdminStatus` and `ifOperStatus` of the polled interfaces in the database.
This column is normally updated only when an import of a <<deep-dive/provisioning/introduction.adoc#ga-provisioning-introduction, Provisiond>> requisition takes place.
* Send events when the state of a polled interface changes state. The UEIs of these events are:
** `uei.opennms.org/nodes/snmp/interfaceAdminDown`
** `uei.opennms.org/nodes/snmp/interfaceAdminUp`
** `uei.opennms.org/nodes/snmp/interfaceOperDown`
** `uei.opennms.org/nodes/snmp/interfaceOperUp`
** `uei.opennms.org/nodes/snmp/interfaceOperTesting`
** `uei.opennms.org/nodes/snmp/interfaceOperUnknown`
** `uei.opennms.org/nodes/snmp/interfaceOperDormant`
** `uei.opennms.org/nodes/snmp/interfaceOperNotPresent`
** `uei.opennms.org/nodes/snmp/interfaceOperLowerLayerDown`

The appropriate event will be sent whenever:

* a polled interface's `ifAdminStatus` is up and `ifOperStatus` is in a down state at startup
* `ifAdminStatus` is in an up state and `ifOperStatus` transitions to a down state from a not down state
* `ifAdminStatus` is in an up state and `ifOperStatus` transitions to an up state from a not up state
* `ifAdminStatus` transitions to a down state from a not down state
* `ifAdminStatus` transitions to an up state from a not up state

NOTE: It is possible to configure the service to treat additional values of `ifOperStatus` as logically up or down.
In the event that this configuration option is used and `ifOperStatus` transitions to a state configured as a down value that is not literally `down(2)`, both the `uei.opennms.org/nodes/snmp/interfaceOperDown` event and an event for the more specific state is sent.

== Configuration and use

=== Enable the service

By default the SNMP interface poller daemon is not enabled.
To enable it, change the value of the `enabled` attribute of the `service` element that contains a `name` element with the following text: `OpenNMS:Name=SnmpPoller`.

[source, xml]
----
<service enabled="true">
   <name>OpenNMS:Name=SnmpPoller</name>
   <class-name>org.opennms.netmgt.snmpinterfacepoller.jmx.SnmpPollerd</class-name>
   <invoke at="start" pass="0" method="init"/>
   <invoke at="start" pass="1" method="start"/>
   <invoke at="status" pass="0" method="status"/>
   <invoke at="stop" pass="0" method="stop"/>
</service>
----

You must restart {page-component-title} to apply this change.

=== Configure the service

The configuration file is `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/snmp-interface-poller-configuration.xml`.
The default version of this file follows:

Configuration options available:

snmp-interface-poller-configuration::
Top-level element for the snmp-interface-poller-configuration.xml configuration file.
The available attributes are the following:
+
[options="header, autowidth"]
[cols="2,3"]
|===
| Attribute
| Description

| interval
| Default polling interval in milliseconds.

| threads
| Maximum number of threads used for SNMP polling.

| service
| SNMP service string.
Almost always "SNMP".

| useCriteriaFilters
a| Flag that indicates if interfaces that do not match the criteria attribute of an interface element in an otherwise matching package should be polled with default settings.

* When "false" such an interface will be polled with default settings.
* When "true" that interface will not be polled.

| up-values
| Values of `ifAdminStatus` and `ifOperStatus` to treat as up values.
Expects a comma-separated list of integer values between 1 and 7.
Example: `1,5`.
Defaults to `1`.

| down-values
| Values of `ifAdminStatus` and `ifOperStatus` to treat as down values.
Expects a comma-separated list of integer values between 1 and 7.
Example: `2,3,4,6,7`.
Defaults to `2`.
|===

node-outage::
Polling will not be attempted if any of the critical service(s) contained in this element are unavailable on a node interface.

critical-service::
The `name` attribute of this element indicates the name of a service that, when unavailable, will prevent the attempted polling of SNMP interfaces on a node interface.

package::
Similar to <<deep-dive/service-assurance/introduction.adoc#ga-service-assurance, Service Assurance>> and <<deep-dive/performance-data-collection/introduction.adoc#performance-management, Performance Management>> packages, this service uses package elements to allow different settings to be used for different types of devices.
Has a single attribute, `name`, which is mandatory.

filter::
Mandatory.
Behaves like `filter` elements in <<deep-dive/service-assurance/polling-packages.adoc#ga-pollerd-packages, pollerd packages>>.

specific:: Behaves like `specific` elements in <<deep-dive/service-assurance/polling-packages.adoc#ga-pollerd-packages, pollerd packages>>.

include-range:: Behaves like `include-range` elements in <<deep-dive/service-assurance/polling-packages.adoc#ga-pollerd-packages, pollerd packages>>.

exclude-range:: Behaves like `exclude-range` elements in <<deep-dive/service-assurance/polling-packages.adoc#ga-pollerd-packages, pollerd packages>>.

include-url:: Behaves like `include-url` in <<deep-dive/service-assurance/polling-packages.adoc#ga-pollerd-packages, pollerd packages>>.

NOTE: The `filter`, `specific`, `include-range`, `exclude-range`, and `include-url` elements apply to the node and interface on which the SNMP interface data resides, not the SNMP interfaces themselves.

interface:: Controls how, when, and (sometimes) which kinds of SNMP interfaces will be polled for status from management interfaces that match the package rules.
The available attributes are:
+
[options="header, autowidth"]
[cols="2,3"]
|===
| Attribute
| Description

| name
| Name for this interface element.
We suggest that you make the name representative of the criteria filter of the interface.
Required.

| criteria
| Criteria added to the SQL query performed on the SNMP interfaces available for polling on an interface node.
Can have more than one.
Lets you specify different settings for different types of interfaces.
As noted above, if `useCriteriaFilters` is `true` on the top-level element, any interface that does not match the criteria filter on one of the interface elements will not be polled.

| interval
| Polling interval for interfaces matching this element's criteria, in milliseconds.
Overrides the global setting in the top-level element for interfaces that match this element's criteria filter.

| user-defined
| An unused Boolean value reserved for use in the UI, should one ever exist for this service.
Defaults to `false`.

| status
| When `off` polling will not be performed for SNMP interfaces that meet the criteria filter of this element.
Defaults to `on`.

| port
| If set, overrides UDP port 161 as the port where SNMP GET/GETNEXT/GETBULK requests are sent.
Valid values are between 1 and 65535.

| retry
| Number of retry attempts made when attempting to retrieve `ifAdminStatus` and `ifOperStatus` values from the management interface for SNMP interfaces that match this element's criteria filter.

| timeout
| Timeout, in milliseconds, to wait for a response to SNMP GET/GETNEXT/GETBULK requests sent to the node interface.

| max-vars-per-pdu
| Number of variables to send per SNMP request.
Default is `10`.

| up-values
| Values of `ifAdminStatus` and `ifOperStatus` to treat as up values.
Expects a comma-separated list of integer values between 1 and 7.
Example: `1,5`.
Defaults to `1`.

| down-values
| Values of `ifAdminStatus` and `ifOperStatus` to treat as down values.
Expects a comma-separated list of integer values between 1 and 7.
Example: `2,3,4,6,7`.
Defaults to `2`.
|===

=== Configure device interfaces to poll

Besides enabling the service and configuring packages and interfaces, you must add a policy that enables polling to the foreign source definition of the requisition(s) for the devices on which you want to use this feature.

Use the `ENABLE_POLLING` and `DISABLE_POLLING` actions of the <<reference:provisioning/policies/snmp-interface.adoc#snmp-interface-policy, matching SNMP interface policy>> to manage which SNMP interfaces this service polls, along with the appropriate `matchBehavior` and parameters.

As an example, you could create a policy named `pollVoIPDialPeers` that flags interfaces with `ifType = 104` for polling.
Set the `action` to `ENABLE_POLLING` and `matchBehavior` to `ALL_PARAMETERS`.
Add parameter `ifType` with `104` for the value.
Once you synchronize the requisition, SNMP interface polling will begin for all SNMP interfaces with `ifType 104` found on node interfaces matching the filter of a package in the SNMP interface poller config file.

As explained in the prior sections, exactly how and when the polling is performed is controlled by the settings on the `interface` element the SNMP interface matches in that package.
If an SNMP interface does not match the criteria of any `interface` element in a package, default settings are used, unless `useCriteriaFilters` is set to true in the top-level element, in which case no polling is performed.
