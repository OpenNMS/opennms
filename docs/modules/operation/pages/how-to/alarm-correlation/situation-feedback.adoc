== Situation Feedback

Situation feedback lets operators provide real-time feedback on alarm correlation.

=== Installation

Enable situation feedback by installing the feature from the Karaf shell:

`feature:install opennms-situation-feedback`

To ensure that the feature continues to be installed on subsequent restarts, add `opennms-situation-feedback` to a file in `featuresBoot.d`:
[source, console]
----
echo "opennms-situation-feedback" | sudo tee ${OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/featuresBoot.d/opennms-situation-feedback.boot
----

=== Requirements

The feature requires Elasticsearch to persist the feedback records.

==== Configure Elasticsearch Persistence

From a Karaf shell on your {page-component-title} instance, start by configuring the situation feedback persistence to use your Elasticsearch cluster:

[source]
----
$ ssh -p 8101 admin@localhost
...
admin@opennms()> config:edit org.opennms.features.situationfeedback.persistence.elastic
admin@opennms()> config:property-set elasticUrl http://elastic:9200
admin@opennms()> config:update
----

NOTE: This configuration is stored in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/org.opennms.features.situationfeedback.persistence.elastic.cfg`.
      See <<deep-dive/elasticsearch/introduction.adoc#ga-elasticsearch-integration, Elasticsearch Integration>> for more information.

Installing the feature exposes a REST endpoint that OpenNMS Helm uses to display and submit feedback.

Find further information on the REST API in the xref:development:rest/situation-feedback.adoc[Developer Guide].
