= Flow Support

NOTE: Flow support is described in detail <<deep-dive/flows/introduction.adoc#ga-flow-support-introduction, here>>.

When persisting flows into Elasticsearch, every flow is represented by a single document.

The following table describes a subset of the fields in the flow document:

[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Field | Description

| @timestamp | Timestamp, in milliseconds, at which the exporter sent the flow.

| location | Monitoring location at which the flow was received.
This will be `Default` unless you are using Minion.

| netflow.bytes | Number of bytes transferred in the flow.

| netflow.last_switched  | Timestamp, in milliseconds, at which the last packet of the flow was transferred.

| netflow.direction | ingress or egress

| netflow.first_switched | Timestamp, in milliseconds, at which the first packet of the flow was transferred.

| netflow.input_snmp | SNMP interface index on which packets related to this flow were received.

| netflow.output_snmp | SNMP interface index on which packets related to this flow were forwarded.
