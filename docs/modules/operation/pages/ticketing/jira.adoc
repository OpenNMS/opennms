= Jira Ticketing Plugin

The Jira ticketing plugin creates JIRA issues in response to {page-component-title} alarms.

[[ga-ticketing-jira-setup]]
== Setup

First, you'll need to install the `opennms-plugin-ticketer-jira` package for your system.
The Jira ticketing plugin and its dependencies are not part of the core packages.

To enable the plugin, start by setting following property in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/opennms.properties`:

[source]
----
opennms.ticketer.plugin=org.opennms.netmgt.ticketd.OSGiBasedTicketerPlugin
----

Configure the plugin options by setting the following properties in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/jira.properties`:

[options="header, %autowidth"]
|===
| Name                    | Description
| `jira.host`             | Jira server URL
| `jira.username`         | Username
| `jira.password`         | Password
| `jira.project`          | The key of the project to use. Use `jira:list-projects` command to determine the project key.
| `jira.type`             | The issue type ID to use when opening new issues. Use `jira:list-issue-types` command to determine the issue type ID.
| `jira.resolve`          | Name of the transition to use when resolving issues
| `jira.reopen`           | Name of the transition to use when reopening issues
| `jira.status.open`      | Comma-separated list of Jira status names for which the ticket should be considered 'Open'
| `jira.status.closed`    | Comma-separated list of Jira status names for which the ticket should be considered 'Closed'
| `jira.status.cancelled` | Comma-separated list of Jira status names for which the ticket should be considered 'Canceled'
| `jira.cache.reloadTime` | The time in milliseconds it takes to reload the fields cache.
                            This is required to prevent the plugin to read the issue type's metadata every time an issue is created.
                            A value of 0 disables the cache.
                            Default value is `300000` (5 minutes).
|===

NOTES: The transition names for `resolve` and `reopen` are typically found on buttons when looking at the ticket in Jira.

Either use `opennms:jist-list-issue-types` OSGI Command or https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA050/Finding+the+Id+for+Issue+Types[Finding the Id for Issue Types] for determining the appropriate issue type ID.

Next, add `jira-troubleticketer` to the `featuresBoot` property in the `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/org.apache.karaf.features.cfg`

Restart {page-component-title}.

When {page-component-title} has started again, login to the Karaf Shell and install the feature:

[source]
----
feature:install jira-troubleticketer
----

The plugin should be ready to use.

== Jira Commands

The Jira ticketing plugin provides various OSGi commands to help set up the plugin on the Karaf Shell.

There are OSGi commands to list all available projects, versions, components, groups, issue types, and more.

To list all available commands simply type `help | grep jira` in the Karaf Shell.

Afterwards you can type, for example, `opennms:jira-list-projects --help` to determine the use of a command.

== Custom Fields

The {page-component-title} ticketer model is limited to the most common fields provided by all ticketing systems.

Besides the common fields creator, create date, description, or subject, ticket system-proprietary fields usually need to be set.

In some cases, even so-called additional custom fields are defined.

To set these fields, the Jira ticketing plugin provides the opportunity to define those in the OpenNMS ticket attributes, which can be overwritten with Drools use.

To enable the Drools ticketing integration, set the following property in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/opennms.properties`:

[source]
----
opennms.ticketer.servicelayer=org.opennms.netmgt.ticketd.DroolsTicketerServiceLayer
----

In addition, the property in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME/etc/drools-ticketer.properties` must point to a `drools-ticketer-rules.drl` file:

[source]
----
drools-ticketer.rules-file=$\{OPENNMS_HOME/etc/drools-ticketer-rules.drl
----

Finally, you must place a Drools rule file named `drools-ticketer-rules.drl` in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc`.


The following Drools example snippet defines attributes to set custom fields:
[source, drools]
----
// Set ticket defaults
rule "TicketDefaults"
salience 100
 when
  $alarm : OnmsAlarm()
 then
  ticket.setSummary($alarm.logMsg);
  ticket.setDetails($alarm.description);
  ticket.addAttribute("customfield_10111", "custom-value");
  ticket.addAttribute("customfield_10112", "my-location");
  ticket.addAttribute("customfield_10113", "some classification");
end
----

Fields must be referenced by their ID.
Use the `opennms:jira-list-fields` to identify the ID of a field. 
By default only custom fields are shown.
The `-s` option shows all fields.
This may be necessary you need to set if Jira default values as well, e.g., the Component, the Reporter, the Asignee, etc.
Even the project key or issue type can be defined differently than originally in the `jira.properties`.

The OpenNMS ticketer attribute model allows you to to set only a string value.
However the Jira model is slightly different.
Therefore, each string value must be converted to a Jira field type.
The following table describes valid values for an OpenNMS attribute.

[options="header, %autowidth"]
|===
| Type                    | Description
| `any`                   | Any string.
| `date`                  | Any date in the format of `YYYY-MM-DD`.
| `datetime`              | Any date-time in ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sTZD`.
| `group`                 | The name of the group.
| `user`                  | The name of the user.
| `project`               | The key of the project (e.g., `NMS`)
| `version`               | The name of the version. To list all available versions, use `jira:list-versions`.
| `string`                | Any string.
| `option`                | The name of the option.
| `issuetype`             | The name of the issue tpye, e.g., `Bug`. To list all issue types, use `jira:list-issue-types`.
| `priority`              | The name of the priority, e.g., `Major`. To list all priorites, use `jira:list-priorities`.
| `option-with-child`     | Either the name of the option, or a comma-separated list (e.g., `parent,child`).
| `number`                | Any valid number (e.g., `1000`).
| `array`                 | If the type is `array`, the value must be of the containing type.
                            For example, to set a custom field which defines multiple groups, the value `jira-users,jira-administrators` is mapped properly.
                            The same is valid for versions: `18.0.3,19.0.0`.
|===

As described above, the values are usually identified by their name instead of their ID (projects are identified by their key).
This is easier to read, but may break the mapping code, if for example the name of a component changes in the future.
To change the mapping from `name` (or `key`) to `id` make an entry in `jira.properties`:

    jira.attributes.customfield_10113.resolution=id

The following Jira (custom) fields have been tested with Jira version #`6.3.15`#:

 * Checkboxes
 * Date Picker
 * Date Time Picker
 * Group Picker (multiple groups)
 * Group Picker (single group)
 * Labels
 * Number Field
 * Project Picker (single project)

 * Text Field (read only)
 * Text Field (single line)
 * URL Field
 * User Picker (multiple user)
 * User Picker (single user)
 * Version Picker (multiple versions)
 * Version Picker (single version)

NOTE: All other field types are mapped as is and therefore may not work.

=== Examples
The following output is the result of the command `opennms:jira-list-fields -h http://localhost:8080 -u admin -p testtest -k DUM -i Bug -s` and lists all available fields for project with key `DUM` and issue type `Bug`:

== Troubleshooting

When troubleshooting, consult the following log files:

* $\{OPENNMS_HOME}/data/log/karaf.log
* $\{OPENNMS_HOME}/logs/trouble-ticketer.log

You can also try the `opennms:jira-verify` OSGi command to help identify problems in your configuration.
