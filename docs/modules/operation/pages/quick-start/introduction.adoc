This Quick Start guide assumes that you have already completed the xref:deployment:core/introduction.adoc[deployment steps], have xref:deployment:core/getting-started.adoc[installed a {page-component-title} instance], and that you are able to connect to the web UI at `\http://<ip-or-fqdn-of-your-server>:8980/opennms`.

The guide includes steps to set up basic monitoring with {page-component-title}, and involves minimal configuration.
For more in-depth information on any topic, see the xref:operation:deep-dive/introduction.adoc[Deep Dive] section.

== Introduction

* Self-monitoring via JMX data collection.

* Reception and recognition of SNMP traps from over 200 MIBs.
* Collection of SNMP performance data from over 200 families of SNMP-capable devices.
