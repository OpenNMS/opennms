= Step 3: Provision Inventory

{page-component-title} installs with a base configuration that automatically begins service-level monitoring and reporting as soon as you identify and catalog (provision) the managed entities (nodes, IP interfaces, SNMP interfaces, and services) that you want to monitor.

{page-component-title} has three methods of provisioning:

* xref:deep-dive/provisioning/auto-discovery.adoc[] (automatically add nodes).
* xref:deep-dive/provisioning/directed-discovery.adoc[] (manually add nodes).
* xref:development:rest/rest-api.adoc#rest-api[Asset import] through the RestAPI.

Auto discovery is useful if you do not have a "source of truth" for your network inventory.
Directed discovery is effective if you know your inventory, particularly if you have a smaller network (for example, 100â€“200 nodes).

Regardless of the method, provisioning is an iterative process.
You will need to fine-tune your results to exclude or add to what you monitor.

This Quick Start guide presents a very basic example of auto discovery of nodes, through SNMP.
Beyond this guide, you can complete additional tasks to provision your system:

* Use plugins to integrate with external systems.
* Specify more complex entity detection with OpenNMS detectors (ActiveMQ, DNS, FTP, JDBC, TCP, and so on).
* Create policies to manage provisioning behavior.

Refer to xref:operation:deep-dive/provisioning/introduction.adoc[Provisioning] in the Deep Dive section for details about these and other provisioning-related tasks.

[[provision-snmp-configuration]]
== Configure SNMP for provisioning

To collect data through SNMP or monitor the availability of SNMP services on a node, you need to configure SNMP for provisioning.
This ensures that {page-component-title} can immediately scan newly discovered devices for entities.

Proper SNMP configuration lets {page-component-title} understand network and node topology and automatically enables performance data collection.
{page-component-title} updates network topology as it provisions nodes.

This procedure illustrates a very basic SNMP configuration using the default parameters.
You can customize these values for your own network needs.

. Click the *Gear* symbol in the top-right of the screen.
. Under Provisioning, click *Configure SNMP Community Names by IP Address*.
. Under General Parameters, specify an IP range using the *First IP Address* and *Last IP Address* boxes, and accept the default values for the other fields.
. Scroll to the bottom and click *Save Config*.
+
This screen sets up SNMP within {page-component-title} for agents listening on IP addresses `10.1.1.1` through `10.254.254.254`.

These settings are optimized into the `snmp-config.xml` file.

For an example of the resulting XML configuration, see xref:operation:deep-dive/provisioning/xml-samples.adoc#SNMP-community-xml[Configure SNMP community names] in the Deep Dive section.

[[requisition-create]]
== Create a requisition

A requisition is a set of nodes (networked devices) to import into {page-component-title} for monitoring and management.

Organizing nodes with a similar network monitoring profile into a requisition (for example, routers or switches) lets you assign the same services, detectors, and policies for network monitoring behavior.

A requisition includes a default foreign source definition that serves as a template to define the services to detect on (DNS, FTP, ICMP, and so on), the scan interval for discovery, and the policies to use when provisioning.

While you can perform discovery without a requisition and edit it later, we recommend that you create a requisition before discovery.
You can iteratively build a requisition and import the requisition's nodes into {page-component-title} later.
Doing this will process all additions, changes, and deletions at once.

This procedure describes how to create an empty requisition using the default foreign source definition.
See the links at the end of the procedure for additional information on customizing a requisition.

To create a requisition, follow these steps:

. Click the *Gear* symbol in the top-right of the screen.
. Under Provisioning, click *Manage Provisioning Requisitions*.
. Click *Add Requisition*, type a name (for example, QuickStartRequisition), and click *OK*.

NOTE: The requisition remains red until you synchronize it with the database.
Synchronize after you configure discovery.

image::provisioning/red_requisition.png[]

Once created, you can add nodes to the requisition.

IMPORTANT: The requisition editor in the OpenNMS web UI is designed for small-scale use.
Do not attempt to use this interface to edit requisitions containing more than a few dozen nodes.
It is not designed for that use case and will fail.

Additional configuration options for requisitions:

* xref:deep-dive/provisioning/directed-discovery.adoc#directed-discovery[Manually specify nodes to add to a requisition].
* xref:deep-dive/provisioning/auto-discovery.adoc#auto-discovery[Automatically discover nodes to add to a requisition].
* Customize a requisition with xref:reference:provisioning/detectors.adoc#ref-detectors[detectors] and xref:deep-dive/provisioning/policies.adoc#policies[policies].

[[configure-discovery]]
== Configure discovery

For this Quick Start guide, we assume that you do not have a list of nodes to start from.
The procedure uses the default general settings for parameters like timeouts and retries.
You can customize these for your own needs.

To configure discovery, follow these steps:

. Click the *Gear* symbol in the top-right of the screen.
. Under Provisioning, click *Configure Discovery*.
. In the *General Settings* area, select the requisition you just created from the *Requisition* list.
** (Optional) Change the default values.
. Click *Save and Restart Discovery* in the top-left of the screen.
. Return to *Manage Provisioning Requisitions* and click *Synchronize the Requisition* (image:provisioning/sync_requisition.png[synchronize requisition symbol,20]).
. Choose a scan option and click *Synchronize*.

You can view imported nodes in the main menu under menu:Info[Nodes] at the top of the screen.
