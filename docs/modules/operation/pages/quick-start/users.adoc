= Step 1: First-Time Login

This section describes the first-time login to OpenNMS {page-component-title}, how to change the `admin` account password, and how to create a user account.

For additional information and procedures on user management, including user groups, user configuration, and security roles, see xref:deep-dive/user-management/user-config.adoc[User Management] in the Deep Dive section.

== First-time login and data choices

Access the {page-component-title} web application at `\http://<ip-or-fqdn-of-your-server>:8980/opennms`.

The default user login is `admin` with the password `admin`.

The first time you log in, we prompt for permission to allow the Data Choices module to collect and publish anonymous usage statistics to https://stats.opennms.org.
The OpenNMS Group uses this anonymized information to help determine product usage and to improve the {page-component-title} software.
We do not share it with third parties.

Click *Show me what is being sent* to see what xref:deep-dive/admin/housekeeping/introduction.adoc#ga-data-collection[information we collect].
Statistics collection and publication happen only if an admin user opts in.

NOTE: Admin users can xref:deep-dive/admin/housekeeping/introduction.adoc#disable-data-collection[enable or disable usage statistics collection] at any time.

[[ga-admin-user-setup]]
== Admin user setup

After logging in for the first time, make sure to change the default `admin` account password to a secure one:

. Click the *Gear* symbol at the top-right of the screen.
. Choose menu:OpenNMS System[Configure Users, Groups and On-Call Roles > Configure Users].
. Click *Modify* beside the `admin` user.
. In the User Password area, click *Reset Password*.
. Update the password and click *OK*.
. Click *Finish* at the bottom of the *Modify User* screen to save changes.

We recommend that you do not use the default `admin` user account, but instead xref:deep-dive/user-management/user-config.adoc#ga-user-config[create specific users] with the Admin role and other permissions.
This helps to keep track of who has performed tasks such as clearing alarms or creating notifications.

For the purposes of this Quick Start guide, create one new user account for yourself, assign it the Admin role, and configure your email address and any other relevant contact information:

. Log in using the default `admin` account.
. Click the *Gear* symbol at the top-right of the screen, and choose menu:Configure OpenNMS[Configure Users, Groups and On-Call Roles > Configure Users].
. Click *Add New User*, specify a user ID and password, confirm the password, and click *OK*.
. Enter your information:
** In the User Information section, type your name in the *Full Name* box.
** In the Security Roles section, select `ROLE_ADMIN` in the *Available Roles* list and click *Add >>* to add it to your account.
*** (Optional) Add xref:operation:deep-dive/user-management/security-roles.adoc[other security roles].
** In the Notification Information section, add your email address in the *Email* box.
*** (Optional) Add other contact information (for example, a mobile phone number).
. Click *Finish* at the bottom of the screen to create the account.

You will need this user account for the next step: xref:operation:quick-start/notifications.adoc[Turn on Default Notifications].

WARNING: Do not delete the default `admin` and `rtc` user accounts.
The `rtc` user account is used for the communication of the Real-Time Console on the start page to calculate the node and service availability.
You should still change the password of the `admin` user to be more secure.
