= Step 9: Visualize Data

This section describes how to visualize your environment's data (using the dashboard, graphs, and so on) in {page-component-title}.

== {page-component-title} home page

The {page-component-title} home page presents an overview of important network status metrics, as soon as you log in.
By default, it displays pending situations and problems, ongoing outages, 24-hour availability statistics, and a map displaying real-time regional status data.

By default, the visualizations on the home page are not filtered.
You can apply filters to the data using the sections on the right side of the screen (Resource Graphs, KSC Reports, and Quick Search).

For more information, see xref:operation:deep-dive/admin/webui/grafana-dashboard-box.adoc[Grafana Dashboard Box] in the Deep Dive section.

[[qs-visualize-dashboard]]
== Dashboard

You can view the default dashboard by clicking menu:Dashboards[Dashboard] in the top menu bar.
The dashboard compiles network environment data to generate an overview of monitored components; this information can often be a useful starting point for more detailed analysis of issues.

The dashboard includes the following components:

* *Surveillance view:* lets you model a monitoring context on the dashboard.
+
You can reduce visible information by selecting rows, columns, and cells to focus on, quickly limiting the data you have to sift through.
The rest of the dashboard updates dynamically.

* *Alarms:* shows unacknowledged alarms which should be escalated.
* *Notifications:* shows outstanding and unacknowledged notifications.
* *Outages:* shows all ongoing network outages.
* *Resource graphs:* shows time series reports for performance diagnosis.

For more information on each of the components, see xref:operation:deep-dive/admin/webui/dashboard.adoc[Dashboard] in the Deep Dive section.

[[qs-visualize-ops-board]]
== Operator board

An operator board (ops board) helps you visualize monitoring information by configuring dashlets to display different kinds of data (alarms, maps, KSC reports, and so on).
Each dashlet visualizes specific information.
You can combine dashlets to build an overview of your environment that best suits your needs.

Only users with admin permissions can create and configure ops boards.
Follow these steps to create a new operator board:

. Click the *Gear* symbol at the top-right of the screen.
. Under Additional Tools, click *Ops Board Configuration*.
. Click the *Plus* symbol (*+*) beside the Overview tab, type a name for the new ops board, and click *Save*.
. Click *Add Dashlet*, select a dashlet from the *Dashlet* list, and configure its settings:
** *Title:* dashlet name to display in the ops board.
** *Priority:* how often the dashlet displays in the rotation.
Priority 1 is the highest, meaning it appears the most often.
** *Duration:* how long the dashlet displays in the rotation, in seconds.
** *Boost-Priority:* change the dashlet's priority if it is in the alert state.
This setting is optional, and is not available for all dashlets.
** *Boost-Duration:* change the display duration if the dashlet is in the alert state.
This setting is optional, and is not available for all dashlets.
** (Optional) Click *Properties* to configure additional settings (alarm severity, chart type, and so on).
. Click the *Up Arrow* and *Down Arrow* symbols to change the dashlet's order.
This affects its rotation order in the Ops Board view, or its position in the Ops Panel view.
. Click *Preview* in the dashlet settings area to preview the dashlet.
. Click *Preview* beside the operator board name to preview the board and all of its dashlets.

The board's configuration is automatically saved.
To view the ops board, click menu:Dashboards[Ops Board] in the menu bar.

For more information about ops boards and dashlets, see xref:operation:deep-dive/admin/webui/opsboard/introduction.adoc[Operator Board] in the Deep Dive section.

== Surveillance View

The Surveillance View is similar to its component of the same name in the <<#qs-visualize-dashboard, Dashboard>>.
Click menu:Status[Surveillance] in the top menu bar to view it.

Just like in the Dashboard, you can select rows, columns, and cells to narrow your data focus.

For more information, see xref:operation:deep-dive/admin/webui/surveillance-view.adoc[Surveillance View] in the Deep Dive section.

== Heatmap

You can use the heatmap to display either unacknowledged alarms or ongoing node outages.
Each visualization can be applied to categories, foreign sources, or node services.

Click menu:Status[Heatmap] in the top menu bar to view the heatmap.

For more information, see xref:operation:deep-dive/admin/webui/heatmap.adoc[Heatmap] in the Deep Dive section.

== Trend

The Trend page displays small, inline charts of database-related statistics (nodes experiencing outages, unacknowledged alarms, and so on).
Click menu:Status[Trend] in the top menu bar to view it.

For more information, see xref:operation:deep-dive/admin/webui/trends.adoc[Trend] in the Deep Dive section.

== Beyond Quick Start

Refer to xref:operation:deep-dive/admin/webui/introduction.adoc[Administrative Web Interface] in the Deep Dive section for more information on visualizations, including the following:
