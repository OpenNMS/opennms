= Step 2: Turn on Default Notifications

This section describes how to turn on default notifications in {page-component-title}.

{page-component-title} uses notifications to inform users about events in the network without requiring them to log in to the web UI.
Notifications are commonly sent through email and text/pager messages, but can be customized to send to a variety of external systems.
For additional information, including alternative notification mechanisms, see xref:operation:deep-dive/notifications/introduction.adoc[Notifications] in the Deep Dive section and the xref:reference:daemons/daemon-config-files/notifd.adoc[notifd daemon] reference section.

== Enable notifications

Notifications are disabled by default in a fresh {page-component-title} installation.
Follow these steps to enable notifications:

. Log in as a user with admin privileges.
. Click the *Gear* symbol in the top-right of the screen.
. Under Event Management, click *On* beside Notification Status, and click *Update*.

The green bell symbol at the top-left of the screen indicates that notifications are enabled globally.

NOTE: The workflow above is functionally equivalent to editing `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/notifd-configuration.xml` and setting `status="on"` in the top-level `notifd-configuration` element.
This configuration file update happens immediately, with no need to restart {page-component-title}.

The following event notifications are defined by default:

* High threshold (off by default)
* High threshold rearmed (off by default)
* Low threshold (off by default)
* Low threshold rearmed (off by default)
* interfaceDeleted (on by default)
* interfaceDown (on by default)
* nodeAdded (on by default)
* nodeDown (on by default)
* nodeLostService (on by default)

You can turn them on and off in the menu:Event Management[Configure Notifications > Configure Event Notifications] screen.
See xref:operation:deep-dive/notifications/introduction.adoc[Notifications] in the Deep Dive section for more information.

== Configure destination paths

A destination path specifies the "who" (recipient), "when" (delay), and "how" (method) of a notification.
It also specifies escalation targets.
Configuring destination paths separately from individual events lets you use the same information for multiple notifications.
This minimizes duplication and encourages reuse.

You must specify a destination path to receive notifications from {page-component-title}.
The `Email-Admin` destination path is defined by default, and is the notification path when no other destination paths are specified.
It sends email notifications to users in the Admin group.

Follow these steps to define a new destination path:

. Log in as a user with admin privileges.
. Click the *Gear* symbol in the top-right of the screen, and choose menu:Event Management[Configure Notifications > Configure Destination Paths].
. Click *New Path* and configure it:
.. Specify a name for the path (for example, Email-Bob) and define an initial delay.
.. Click *Edit*, and select the users, groups, roles, or email addresses to send notifications to.
*** To add a single email address to the Send to Email Addresses list, click *Add Address*, type the email address, and click *OK*.
*** To remove email addresses from the Send to Email Addresses list, select them from the list and click *Remove Selected Addresses*.
.. Click *Next Step*.
.. (Optional) Define a delay interval for group notification.
This will determine the delay between sending notifications to each member of a group.
+
For example, defining a five minute delay will mean that, when a notification is generated, the first member of the group will be notified immediately.
Subsequent members will then be notified in five-minute increments, from the top of the list of group members to the bottom.

.. Click *Next Step*.
.. Select `javaEmail` from the list of commands and make sure it is on.
.. Click *Next Step*.
+
The users, groups, roles, or email addresses appear in the Initial Targets list.

. Verify the path's settings, and click *Finish*.

You can define multiple notifications for the same unique event identifier (UEI) to use different destination paths.
By default, {page-component-title} runs the destination path of all notifications matching the event's UEI.
You can configure notifd to process only the destination path of the first matching notification by editing `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/notifd-configuration.xml` and setting `match-all="false"` in the top-level `notifd-configuration` element.

NOTE: Configuration of destination paths is stored in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/destinationPaths.xml`.
Changes to this file happen immediately, with no need to restart {page-component-title}.
