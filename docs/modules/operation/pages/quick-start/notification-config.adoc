= Step 8: Configure Notifications

This section describes how to configure and customize your {page-component-title} notifications.

NOTE: This step is separate from xref:operation:quick-start/notifications.adoc[setting up default notifications].
We assume that you have followed the previous steps and are ready to proceed to more in-depth work with notifications.

== Configuration and customization

Now that you have xref:operation:quick-start/baseline.adoc[established your environment's baseline], it's time to take your notes and configure your custom notifications.
Establishing notifications that are tailored for your environment and monitoring requirements lets the right people see and respond to the right issues in a timely manner.

Here, we will describe how to configure event notifications.
You can configure event notifications to provide coverage of specific unique event identifiers (UEIs), allowing for granular control of incoming information.

You can define multiple notifications for the same UEI to use different destination paths.
By default, {page-component-title} uses the destination path of all notifications matching the event's UEI.
You can configure notifd to process only the destination path of the first matching notification by editing `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/notifd-configuration.xml` and setting `match-all="false"` in the top-level `notifd-configuration` element.

NOTE: Changes to `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/destinationPaths.xml` happen immediately, with no need to restart {page-component-title}.

== Configure event notifications

An event notification defines a destination path and message template for a specific UEI.
It is possible to define multiple notifications for the same UEI to use different filters, destination paths, and message templates.
Follow these steps to configure event notifications:

. Click the *Gear* symbol in the top-right of the screen.
. Under Event Management, click menu:Configure Notifications[Configure Event Notifications].
A list of events that are configured for notifications is displayed.
. Click *Add New Event Notification*, choose the UEI that will trigger a notification, and click *Next*.
. (Optional) Build a rule to match a subset of IP addresses or services, and click menu:Validate Rule Results[Next] or *Skip Results Validation*.
If you do not build a rule, notifications will be generated for all monitored IP addresses.
. In the *Choose Path* screen, specify information to include in the notification, including the destination path, subject (for email messages), body text, and so on.
. Click *Finish*.

NOTE: Event notification configuration is stored in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/notifications.xml`.
Changes to this file happen immediately, with no need to restart {page-component-title}.

=== Filter rules

A filter rule lets you define which notifications to send or save.
Strict rules are always evaluated, and if there is no node or interface associated with the event, the notification will not be saved.
Filter rules work alongside your event notification configuration to enable better, more fine-tuned control over the notifications that you receive.

By default, the filter rule configured in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/notifications.xml` (for example, `<rule>IPADDR != '0.0.0.0'</rule>`) does not have the `strict` flag enabled.
That means if there is an event that is not associated with a node or interface (and therefore no `IPADDR` value), it will bypass validation and the notification would be processed.

A strict rule (for example, `<rule strict="true">IPADDR != '0.0.0.0'</rule>`) will always be evaluated, and if there is no node or interface associated with the event, the notification will not be saved.
