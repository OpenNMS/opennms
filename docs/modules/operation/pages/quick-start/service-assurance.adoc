= Step 7: Determine Service Availability

By default, {page-component-title} monitors a number of services including ICMP, DNS, Elasticsearch, SMTP, FTP, SNMP, HTTP(S), SSH, Postgres, IMAP, and POP3.
Using a service monitor framework with pollerd as the main component, {page-component-title} detects if a service is available, then monitors it for its availability and response time.
You can view a summary of this availability information, calculated over the last 24 hours, on the main dashboard.
You can also view a summary of availability information on a per-node basis.

Pollerd schedules and runs service monitors, as defined in `poller-configuration.xml`.
When a service monitor detects an outage, pollerd sends an event which {page-component-title} uses to create an alarm.
You can also use events to generate a notification for on-call network or server administrators.
