= Step 7: Determine Service Availability

By default, {page-component-title} monitors a number of services, including ICMP, DNS, Elasticsearch, SMTP, FTP, SNMP, HTTP(S), SSH, Postgres, IMAP, and POP3.

Using a service monitor framework with xref:reference:daemons/daemon-config-files/pollerd.adoc[pollerd] as the main component, provisioning detectors detect the existence of a service, and pollerd runs the monitors to test service availability and measure response time.
You can view a summary of this availability information, calculated over the last 24 hours, on the main dashboard:

.Service availability summary
image::operation:service-assurance/service-availability.png["{page-component-title} dashboard displaying service availability statistics for the localhost node"]

Pollerd schedules and runs service monitors, as defined in `poller-configuration.xml`.
When a service monitor detects an outage, pollerd sends an event that {page-component-title} uses to create an alarm.
You can also use events to generate notifications for on-call network or server administrators.
