= Logging

{page-component-title} stores logs in different files in the file system depending and named on the daemon that was acting on a process.

For example, logs for xref:operation:service-assurance/introduction.adoc#ga-service-assurance[service assurance checks] that are done by `pollerd` are stored in the `pollerd.log` file.

The log files can be found in `/var/log/opennms/`.


For information on the different log files, how they are named, and what they include, see xref:reference:logging/introduction.adoc[List of log files].

== Change logging

{page-component-title} uses the https://logging.apache.org/log4j/[Apache Log4j] framework to manage how the logs are written, structured, or rotated.

The configuration file can be found in `/etc/opennms/log4j2.xml`.

Each daemon can have an individual logging level.

The corresponding configuration in this file can be found in the XML tree path: `configuration/loggers/root/DynamicThresholdFilter/KeyValuePair`.

The default logging level is WARN.
You can set the levels to TRACE, INFO, DEBUG, WARN, or ERROR depending on the need.

For troubleshooting, use DEBUG. 
After saving the changes in this file, {page-component-title} needs a few seconds to apply the changes.
The additional DEBUG log output is now also being written to the corresponding log file.

NOTE: Don't forget to set the logging level back to WARN after changing it to a higher severity.
Depending on the scale, {page-component-title} can generate a lot more logs, which requires more disk space.
