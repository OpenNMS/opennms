= Logging

{page-component-title} stores logs based on the name of the daemon that was acting on a process.
For example, logs for xref:operation:service-assurance/introduction.adoc#ga-service-assurance[service assurance checks] that are done by `pollerd` are stored in the `pollerd.log` file.

The log files can be found in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/logs`, which is a symlink to `/var/log/opennms`.

Check the xref:reference:daemons/introduction.adoc[list of daemons] to see which log files are associated with each daemon.

== Change logging

{page-component-title} uses the https://logging.apache.org/log4j/[Apache Log4j] framework to manage how the logs are written, structured, and rotated.

The log configuration file can be found in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/opennms/log4j2.xml`.

Each daemon can have an individual logging level.

The corresponding configuration in this file can be found in the XML tree path: `configuration/loggers/root/DynamicThresholdFilter/KeyValuePair`.

The default logging level is `WARN`, and for troubleshooting, use `DEBUG`.
See the table below for a description of the available log levels.
Changes to logging levels are applied immediately and do not require any service or daemon restarts.

NOTE: Don't forget to set the logging level back to WARN after changing it to a higher severity.
Depending on the scale, {page-component-title} can generate a lot of logs, which requires more disk space.

|===
| Level
| Description

| INFO
| Anything likely to be useful to the average user to determine the current general behavior/state of the system.

| WARN
| Messages relating to code that has a failure that might be temporary or recoverable, or code that is misconfigured but can continue running in a regressed state.
This is the recommended default log level.

| ERROR
| Only things that cause code to stop working and be unrecoverable.

| DEBUG
| Additional information that can help diagnose issues.

| TRACE
| Even more additional information that is often useful only to developers.
This mode will output very detailed logs and can cause performance issues if left enabled.
Use sparingly as necessary.
