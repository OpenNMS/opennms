= Back up OpenNMS {page-component-title}

This section describes a basic backup process for a default OpenNMS {page-component-title} xref:deployment:core/getting-started.adoc#getting-started-core[installation].
OpenNMS {page-component-title} binaries, logs, RRD archives, configurations, and the database will be backed up.

NOTE: In this example the backup storage path is `/tmp` for demonstration purposes.
Please be aware that `/tmp` is not persisted, as most operating systems will delete the content at bootup.
