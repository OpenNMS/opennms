= Boosting Dashlet

There are two options to increase how often dashlets that show critical monitoring information (alarms, summaries of alarms) appear in the ops board rotation:

* Boost Priority: Absolute priority of the dashlet with critical monitoring information.
* Boost Duration: Absolute duration in seconds of the dashlet with critical monitoring information.

With the "boost priority" option, the lower the number, the higher the priority, and the more often the dashlet appears in the rotation.
One (1) is the highest priority, so a dashlet with this number appears most frequently.
