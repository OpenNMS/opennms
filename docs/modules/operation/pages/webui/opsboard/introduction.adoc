= Operator Board

In a network operation center (NOC) you can use the ops board to visualize monitoring information.
The monitoring information for various use-cases are arranged in configurable dashlets.
To address different user groups it is possible to create multiple ops boards.

There are two visualisation components to display dashlets:

 * Ops Panel: Shows multiple dashlets on one screen, e.g., on a NOC operators workstation
 * Ops Board: Shows one dashlet at a time in rotation, e.g., for a screen wall in a NOC
