= Elasticsearch Integration

{page-component-title} persists/forwards certain data to Elasticsearch.

The following sections describe the configuration possibilities as well as the available features.

Internally, all Elasticsearch integrations use the https://github.com/searchbox-io/Jest[Jest library] to access the Elasticsearch REST interface.

TIP: If a configuration management tool is used, the properties file can be created and is used as startup configuration

NOTE: If credentials are provided, preemptive authorization is used for all defined Elasticsearch nodes.

.Configuration Example to Access Elasticsearch
[source]
----
elasticUrl=http://elastic:9200
elasticIndexStrategy=daily
globalElasticUser=elastic
globalElasticPassword=changeme

== Credentials

It is possible to define credentials for each Elasticsearch node individually.
Credentials for each node must be stored in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/elastic-credentials.xml`.

.Custom credentials
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<elastic-credentials>
    <credentials url="http://localhost:9200" username="ulf" password="ulf" />
    <credentials url="https://10.10.0.1:9333" username="ulf" password="flu" />
</elastic-credentials>
```

NOTE: Credentials are globally defined and will be used by each feature.
