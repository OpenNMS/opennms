= VmwareMonitor

This monitor is part of the VMware integration provided in Provisiond and tests the power state of a virtual machine (VM) or a host system (host).
If the power state of a VM or host is poweredOn, the service is up.
If the VM or Host is powered off, the service will be marked as down.
By default, standBy is also considered as down.
When using link:https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/techpaper/Distributed-Power-Management-vSphere.pdf[Distributed Power Management] (automatic PDF download), you can change the standBy state.
See the ignoreStandBy parameter.
Optionally, a service down event can be triggered if there are pending alarms within vCenter that have not been acknowledged or cleared.

This monitor requires hosts be imported with Provisiond and the VMware import.
{page-component-title} requires network access to VMware vCenter server and each of the monitored hosts.
The credentials for accessing the status of a VMware entity are collected from the responsible VMware vCenter using the settings from `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/vmware-config.xml`.
This config file also gets specific asset fields assigned to an imported virtual machine and/or host system.
The VMware integration populates the following asset fields via Provisiond:

* VMware Management Server
* VMware Managed Entity Type
* foreignId (which contains an internal VMware vCenter Identifier)
