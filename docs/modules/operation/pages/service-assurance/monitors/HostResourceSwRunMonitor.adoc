= HostResourceSwRunMonitor

This monitor tests the running state of one or more processes.
It does this via SNMP by inspecting the _hrSWRunTable_ of the http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2790[HOST-RESOURCES-MIB].
The test matches a given process as _hrSWRunName_ against the numeric value of the _hrSWRunState_.

This monitor uses SNMP to accomplish its work.
Therefore systems against which it is to be used must have an SNMP agent installed and configured.
Furthermore, the SNMP agent on the system must support the _HOST-RESOURCES-MIB_.
Most modern SNMP agents, including most distributions of the Net-SNMP agent and the SNMP service that ships with Microsoft Windows, support this MIB.
Out-of-box support for _HOST-RESOURCES-MIB_ among commercial Unix operating systems may be somewhat spotty.

| Parameter            | Description                                                                                    | Required | Default value
| `port`               | The port of the SNMP agent of the server to test.                                              | optional | `from snmp-config.xml`
| `service-name`       | The name of the process to be monitored. This parameter's value is case-sensitive and is
                         evaluated as an exact match.                                                                   | required | `-`
| `match-all`          | If the process name appears multiple times in the _hrSWRunTable_, and this parameter is set to
                         `true`, then all instances of the named process must match the value specified for
                         `run-level`.                                                                                   | optional | `false`
| `run-level`          | The maximum allowable value of _hrSWRunStatus_ among +
                         _running(1)_, +
                         _runnable(2)_ = waiting for resource +
                         _notRunnable(3)_ = loaded but waiting for event +
                         _invalid(4)_ = not loaded                                                                      | optional | `2`
| `service-name-oid`   | The numeric object identifier (OID) from which process names are queried. Defaults to
                         _hrSWRunName_ and should never be changed under normal
                         circumstances. That said, changing it to _hrSWRunParameters_ (`.1.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.5`) is
                         often helpful when dealing with processes running under Java Virtual Machines which all have
                         the same process name _java_.                                                                  | optional | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.2`
| `service-status-oid` | The numeric object identifier (OID) from which run status is queried. Defaults to
                         _hrSWRunStatus_ and should never be changed under normal circumstances.                        | optional | `.1.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.7`

This monitor implements the <<service-assurance/monitors/introduction.adoc#ga-service-assurance-monitors-common-parameters, Common Configuration Parameters>>.

== Examples

The following example shows how to monitor the process called _httpd_ running on a server using this monitor.
The configuration in `poller-configuration.xml` has to be defined as the following:
[source, xml]
----
<service name="Process-httpd" interval="300000" user-defined="false" status="on">
    <parameter key="retry" value="3"/>
    <parameter key="timeout" value="3000"/>
    <parameter key="service-name" value="httpd"/><1>
    <parameter key="run-level" value="3"/><2>
    <parameter key="match-all" value="true"/><3>
</service>

<monitor service="Process-httpd" class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.poller.monitors.HostResourceSwRunMonitor"/>
----
<1> Name of the process on the system
<2> Test the state if the process is in a valid state, i.e. have a `run-level` no higher than _notRunnable(3)_
<3> If the _httpd_ process runs multiple times the test is done for each instance of the process.
