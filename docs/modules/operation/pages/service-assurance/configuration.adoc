|===

To change the behavior for service monitoring, the `poller-configuration.xml` can be modified.
The configuration file is structured in the following parts:

* Global daemon config
** Define the size of the used Thread Pool to run Service Monitors in parallel.
** Define and configure the Critical Service for Node Event Correlation.
* Polling packages
** Package to allow grouping of configuration parameters for Service Monitors.
* Downtime Model
** Configure the behavior of Pollerd to run tests in case of an Outage is detected.
* Monitor service association
** Based on the name of the service, the implementation for application or network management protocols are assigned.

.Global configuration parameters for Pollerd
[source, xml]
----
<poller-configuration threads="30" <1>
                      pathOutageEnabled="false" <2>
                      serviceUnresponsiveEnabled="false"> <3>
----

<1> Size of the _Thread Pool_ to run _Service Monitors_ in parallel.
<2> Enable or Disable _Path Outage_ functionality based on a _Critical Node_ in a network path.
<3> In case of unresponsive service services a _serviceUnresponsive_ event is generated and not an outage.
    This prevents the application of the _Downtime Model_ in retesting the service after 30 seconds to help prevent false alarms.

Configuration changes are applied by restarting _OpenNMS_ and _Pollerd_.
It is also possible to send an _Event_ to _Pollerd_ reloading the configuration.
An _Event_ can be sent on the _CLI_ or the _Web User Interface_.

.Send configuration reload event on CLI
[source, shell]
----
cd $OPENNMS_HOME/bin
./send-event.pl uei.opennms.org/internal/reloadDaemonConfig --parm 'daemonName Pollerd'

.Send configuration reload event with the Web User Interface

[[ga-pollerd-configuration-meta-data]]
== Metadata DSL
The <<meta-data.adoc#ga-meta-data-dsl, Metadata DSL>>(domain specific language) lets you use dynamic configuration in parameter values to interpolate metadata into the parameter.

The syntax lets you use patterns in an expression, whereby the metadata is replaced with a corresponding value during the collection process.

During evaluation of an expression, the following scopes are available:

* Node metadata
* Interface metadata
* Service metadata
