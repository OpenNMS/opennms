= Downtime Model

By default the monitoring interval for a service is 5 minutes.
To also detect short service outages, caused, for example, by automatic network rerouting, use the downtime model.
On a detected service outage, the interval is reduced to 30 seconds for 5 minutes.
If the service comes back within 5 minutes, a shorter outage is documented and the impact on service availability can be less than 5 minutes.
This configurable behavior is called "downtime model".

.Downtime model with resolved and ongoing outage
image::service-assurance/01_downtime-model.png[]

The above figure (Downtime model with resolved and ongoing outage) shows two outages.
The first shows a short outage which was detected as "up" after 90 seconds.
The second outage is not resolved now and the monitor has not detected an available service and was not available in the first 5 minutes (10 times 30 second polling).
The scheduler changed the polling interval back to 5 minutes.

.Example default configuration of the Downtime Model
[source, xml]
----
<downtime interval="30000" begin="0" end="300000" /><!-- 30s, 0, 5m --><1>
<downtime interval="300000" begin="300000" end="43200000" /><!-- 5m, 5m, 12h --><2>
<downtime interval="600000" begin="43200000" end="432000000" /><!-- 10m, 12h, 5d --><3>
<downtime interval="3600000" begin="432000000" delete="never"/><!-- 1h, 5d --><4>
----
<1> from 0 seconds after an outage is detected until 5 minutes, the polling interval will be set to 30 seconds
<2> after 5 minutes of an ongoing outage until 12 hours, the polling interval will be set to 5 minutes
<3> after 12 hours of an ongoing outage until 5 days, the polling interval will be set to 10 minutes
<4> after 5 days of an ongoing outage the service will be polled only once a hour and we do not delete services

The last downtime interval can have an attribute `delete` and lets you influence the service lifecycle.
It defines the behavior that happens if a service doesn't come back online after the specified interval.
The following downtime attributes for `delete` can be used:

[options="header, autowidth"]
[cols="1,3"]
