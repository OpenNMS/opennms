= Poller Packages

To define more complex monitoring configuration it is possible to group service configurations into polling packages.
They allow you to assign different service configurations to nodes.
To assign a polling package to nodes, use the the https://wiki.opennms.org/wiki/Filters[Rules/Filters] syntax.
Each polling package can have its own <<service-assurance/downtime-model.adoc#ga-service-assurance-downtime-model, Downtime Model>> configuration.

You can configure multiple packages, and an interface can exist in more than one package.
This gives great flexibility to how the service levels will be determined for a given device.

<package name="example1"><1>
  <filter>IPADDR != '0.0.0.0'</filter><2>
  <include-range begin="1.1.1.1" end="254.254.254.254" /><3>

<1> Unique name of the polling package.
<2> Base filter on IP address, categories or asset attributes of nodes based on https://wiki.opennms.org/wiki/Filters[Rules/Filters].
    The filter is evaluated first and is *required*.
    This package is used for all IP interfaces that do not have 0.0.0.0 as an assigned IP address and is *required*.
<3> Allow to specify if the configuration of services is applied on a range of IP interfaces_ (IPv4 or IPv6).

Instead of the `include-range` it is possible to add one or more specific IP interfaces:

It is also possible to exclude IP interfaces:

[[ga-pollerd-packages-response-time-config]]
== Response Time Configuration

The definition of polling packages lets you configure similar services with different polling intervals.
All the response time measurements are persisted in RRD files and require a definition.
Each polling package contains an RRD definition.

<package name="example1">

</rrd>
----
<1> Polling interval for all services in this polling package is reflected in the step of size 300 seconds.
    All services in this package have to be polled in a 5-minute interval, otherwise response time measurements are not persiste correctly.
<2> 1 step size is persisted 2016 times: 1 * 5 min * 2016 = 7 d, 5 min accuracy for 7 d.
<3> 12 steps average persisted 1488 times: 12 * 5 min * 1488 = 62 d, aggregated to 60 min for 62 d.
<4> 288 steps average persisted 366 times: 288 * 5 min * 366 = 366 d, aggregated to 24 h for 366 d.
<5> 288 steps maximum from 24 h persisted for 366 d.
<6> 288 steps minimum from 24 h persisted for 366 d.

WARNING: The RRD configuration and the service polling interval must be aligned.
         #In other cases# the persisted response time data is not correctly displayed in the response time graph.

IMPORTANT: If you change the polling interval afterwards, you must recreate existing RRD files with the new definitions.

[[ga-pollerd-packages-service-status-persistence]]
== Service Status Persistence

You can configure each service monitor to store the current status of the service in RRD files.
This allows you to query the current status and the status history.

This feature is disabled by default.
You must enable it individually for each service.
To do so, add a service parameter to the appropriate services in `poller-configuration.xml`:

[source, xml]
----
<service name="EXAMPLE" ...>
  <parameter key="rrd-status" value="true"/>
</service>
----

[[ga-pollerd-packages-overlapping-service]]
== Overlapping Services

With the possibility of specifying multiple polling packages it is possible to use the same service (like ICMP) multiple times.
The order how polling packages in the `poller-configuration.xml` are defined is important when IP interfaces match multiple polling packages with the same service configuration.

The following example shows which configuration is applied for a specific service:

----
<1> Polling interval in the packages are 300 seconds and 30 seconds
<2> Different polling interval for the ICMP service
<3> Different retry settings for the ICMP service
<4> Different timeout settings for the ICMP service

The last polling package on the service will be applied.
This can be used to define a less specific catch-all filter for a default configuration.
Use a more specific polling package to overwrite the default setting.
In the above example, all IP interfaces in 192.168.1/24 or 2600:/64 will be monitored with ICMP with different polling, retry, and timeout settings.

The WebUI displays which polling packages are applied to the IP interface and service.
The IP Interface and Service pages show which polling package and service configuration is applied for this specific service.

[[ga-pollerd-packages-patterns]]
== Service Patterns

Usually, the poller used to monitor a pervice is found by the matching the poller's name with the service name.
In addition, you can find a matching poller if an additional element `pattern` is specified for the poller.
If so, the poller is used for all services matching the RegEx pattern, too.

The RegEx pattern lets you specify named capture groups.
There can be multiple capture groups inside of a pattern, but each must have a unique name.
Please note, that the RegEx must be escaped or wrapped in a CDATA-Tag inside the configuration XML to make it a valid property.

If a poller is matched using its pattern, the parts of the service name which match the capture groups of the pattern are available as parameters to the <<service-assurance/configuration.adoc#ga-pollerd-configuration-meta-data, Metadata DSL>> using the context `pattern` and the capture group name as key.

Examples:

`<pattern><![CDATA[^HTTP-(?<vhost>.*)$]]></pattern>`::
Matches all services with names starting with `HTTP-` followed by a host name.
If the services is called `HTTP-www.example.com`, the Metadata DSL expression `${pattern:vhost}` will resolve to `www.example.com`.

`<pattern><![CDATA[^HTTP-(?<vhost>.*?):(?<port>[0-9]+)$]]></pattern>"`::
Matches all services with names starting with `HTTP-` followed by a hostname and a port.
There will be two variables (`${pattern:vhost}` and `${pattern:port}`), which you can use in the poller parameters.

Use the service pattern mechanism whenever there are multiple instances of a service on the same interface.
By specifying a distinct service name for each instance, the services is identifiable, but there is no need to add a poller definition per service.
Common use cases for such services are HTTP virtual hosts, where multiple web applications run on the same web server or BGP session monitoring where each router has multiple neighbours.
