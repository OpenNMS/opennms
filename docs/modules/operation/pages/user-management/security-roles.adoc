= Assigning User Permissions

Create user permissions by assigning security roles.
These roles regulate access to the web UI and the REST API to exchange monitoring and inventory information.

== Assigning roles to users
. Log in as a user with administrative permissions.
. Click the gear icon in the top right.
. Choose menu:Configure OpenNMS[Configure Users, Groups and On-Call Roles > Configure Users].
. Click the modify icon next to the user you want to update.
. Select the role from menu:Security Roles[Available Roles].
. Click *Add* to assign the security role to the user.
. Click *Finish* to apply the changes.
. Log out and log in to apply the new security role settings.

== Creating custom security roles

To create a custom security role you need to define the name and specify the security permissions.

* Create a file called `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/security-roles.properties`.
* Add a property called `roles`, and for its value, a comma-separated list of the custom security roles, for example:

```
roles=operator,stage
```

To define permissions associated with the custom security role, manually update the application context of the Spring security here:
```
/opt/opennms/jetty-webapps/opennms/WEB-INF/applicationContext-spring-security.xml
```
