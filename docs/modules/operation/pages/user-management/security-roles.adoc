Create user permissions by assigning security roles. 
These roles regulate access to the web UI and the REST API to exchange monitoring and inventory information.

== Creating custom securitry roles

To create a custom security role you need to define the name and specify the security permissions.

* Create a file called `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/security-roles.properties`.
* Add a property called `roles`, and for its value, a comma-separated list of the custom security roles, for example:

```
roles=operator,stage
```
The new custom security roles will appear in the web UI:

To define permissions associated with the custom security role, manually update the application context of the Spring Security here: 
```
/opt/opennms/jetty-webapps/opennms/WEB-INF/applicationContext-spring-security.xml
```
