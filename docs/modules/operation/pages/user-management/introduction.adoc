* <<user-management/user-oncall.adoc#ga-on-call-role, configuring on-call roles>>

[[ga-data-choices]]
== First-Time Login and Data Choices

Access the {page-component-title} web application at \http://<ip-or-fqdn-of-your-server>:8980/opennms.

The default user login is `admin` with the password `admin`.

The first time you log in we prompt for permission to allow the `Data Choices` module to collect and publish anonymous usage statistics to https://stats.opennms.org.

The OpenNMS Group uses this information to help determine product usage and to improve the {page-component-title} software.

Click *Show me what is being sent* to see what xref:ga-data-collection[information we collect]. 
Statistics collection and publication happen only if an admin user opts in.

NOTE: Admin users can enable or disable usage statistics collection at any time by logging into the UI, clicking the gear icon, selecting *Data Choices* in the *Additional Tools* area, and clicking *Opt-in* or *Opt-out*.

[[ga-data-collection]]
=== Data Collection

When enabled, the `Data Choices` module collects the following anonymous statistics and publishes them on system startup and every 24 hours after:

* System ID (a randomly generated universally unique identifier (UUID))
* {page-component-title} Release
* {page-component-title} Version
* OS Architecture
* OS Name
* OS Version
* Number of alarms in the `alarms` table
* Number of events in the `events` table
* Number of IP interfaces in the `ipinterface` table
* Number of nodes in the `node` table
* Number of nodes, grouped by System OID

[[ga-admin-user-setup]]
=== Admin User Setup

After logging in for the first time, make sure to change the default admin user password to a secure one: 

. Click the gear icon in the top right. 
. Choose *Configure OpenNMS -> Configure Users, Groups and On-Call roles* and select *Configure Users*.
. Click *Modify* beside the admin user.
. In the *User Password* area, click *Reset Password*, update the password and click *OK*.
. Click *Finish* at the bottom of the Modify User screen to save changes. 

WARNING: Please note that angle brackets (<>), single (') and double quotation marks ("), and the ampersand symbol (&) are not allowed to be used in the user ID.

We recommend not using the default `admin` user, but instead <<user-management/user-config.adoc#ga-user-config, creating specific users>> with the admin role and/or other permissions. 
This helps to keep track of who has performed tasks such as clearing alarms or creating notifications. 

WARNING: Do not delete the default _admin_ and _rtc_ users.
         The _rtc_ user is used for the communication of the Real-Time Console on the start page to calculate the node and service availability.
