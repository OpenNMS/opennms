The operational status uses the severities known from events and alarms.

| Name            | Numerical code | Color       / Code   | Description
| Critical      | 7              | Purple      / #c00 | Indicates a severe service-affecting event has occurred.
| Major         | 6              | Red         / #f30 | Indicates serious disruption or malfunction of a service or system.
| Minor         | 5              | Orange      / #f90 | Used for troubles that have no immediate effect on service or system performance.
| Warning       | 4              | Yellow      / #fc0 | An event has occurred that may require action.
                                                            Use this severity to indicate a condition that should be noted (logged) but does not require immediate action.
| Normal        | 3              | Dark green  / #360 | Informational message. No action required.
| Cleared       | 2              | Grey        / #eee | This severity is reserved for use in alarms to indicate that an alarm describes a self-clearing error condition that has been corrected and service is restored.
                                                            Never use this severity in event definitions.
                                                            Use "Normal" severity for events that clear an alarm.
| Indeterminate | 1              | Light green / #990 | No severity could be associated with this event.

If a business service changes its operational status, an OpenNMS event of the type `uei.opennms.org/bsm/serviceOperationalStatusChanged` is generated and sent to the OpenNMS event bus.
In cases where the operational status changed from normal to a higher severity, an event of the type `uei.opennms.org/bsm/serviceProblem` is generated and has the severity of the BS.
When the BS goes back to normal, an event of the type `uei.opennms.org/bsm/serviceProblemResolved` is generated.

NOTE: Use the service problem and service problem resolved events for notifications or ticketing integration.

The log message of the events have the following information:

* Business Service Name: `businessServiceName`
* Business Service Identifier: `id`
* Previous Severity Identifier: `prevSeverityId`
* Previous Severity Label: `prevSeverityLabel`
* New Severity Identifier: `newSeverityId`
* New Severity Label: `newSeverityLabel`
