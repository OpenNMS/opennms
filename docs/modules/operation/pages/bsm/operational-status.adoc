| Name            | Numerical code | Color       / Code   | Description
| `Critical`      | 7              | Purple      / `#c00` | This event means that a severe service affecting event has occurred.
| `Major`         | 6              | Red         / `#f30` | Indicates serious disruption or malfunction of a service or system.
| `Minor`         | 5              | Orange      / `#f90` | Used for troubles that have no immediate effect on service or system performance.
| `Warning`       | 4              | Yellow      / `#fc0` | An event has occurred that may require action.
                                                            Use this severity to indicate a condition that should be noted (logged) but does not require immediate action.
| `Normal`        | 3              | Dark green  / `#360` | Informational message. No action required.
| `Cleared`       | 2              | Grey        / `#eee` | This severity is reserved for use in alarms to indicate that an alarm describes a self-clearing error condition that has been corrected and service is restored.
                                                            Never use this severity in event definitions.
                                                            Please use "Normal" severity for events that clear an alarm.
| `Indeterminate` | 1              | Light green / `#990` | No severity could be associated with this event.

If a business service changes its operational status, an OpenNMS event of the type `uei.opennms.org/bsm/serviceOperationalStatusChanged` is generated and sent to the OpenNMS event bus.
In cases where the operational status changed from normal to a higher severity, an event of the type `uei.opennms.org/bsm/serviceProblem` is generated and has the severity of the BS.
When the BS goes back to normal, an event of the type `uei.opennms.org/bsm/serviceProblemResolved` is generated.

NOTE: Use the service problem and service problem resolved events for notifications or ticketing integration.

The log message of the events have the following information:

* Business Service Name: `businessServiceName`
* Business Service Identifier: `id`
* Previous Severity Identifier: `prevSeverityId`
* Previous Severity Label: `prevSeverityLabel`
* New Severity Identifier: `newSeverityId`
* New Severity Label: `newSeverityLabel`
