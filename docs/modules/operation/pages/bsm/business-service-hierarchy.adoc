= Business Service Hierarchy

BS can depend on each other and together build a business service hierarchy.
Visualize it using the Topology User Interface with the Business Services View.
The operational status of a BS is ultimately calculated from alarms and their serverity.
To define the class of alarms a reduction key is used and is represented as an edge of a BS.
Giving more granularity than just Up or Down, the operational status uses the serverities, i.e., Normal, Warning, Minor, Major, Critical.

Based on the hierarchy, the operational status is calculated with map and reduce functions.
A map function influences which serverity from the edge is used as an input to the BS.
A reduce function consolidates the serverities from all edges of a BS and uses them as inputs and reduces them into a single serverity, which is the operational status.

The Topology User Interface lets users traverse business service hierarchies using the semantic zoom level (SZL).
The semantic zoom level (SZL, pronounced as 'sizzle') defines how many neighbors are shown related to the elements which are in focus.
The number can be interpreted as how many hops from the focus should be shown on the Topology User Interface.

<1> A top-level business service that depends on other business services, monitored services, and alarms (referenced by reduction key)
<2> Business service as child an the operational status is used as input for the top-level business service
<3> IP service edge used as an input with auto-generated reduction keys for node down, interface down, and node lost service
<4> Reduction key edge used as an input to the top-level BS, which references just a node-lost service of a page sequence monitor for the user login

To add or remove an additional selected BS or edge to focus use, in the context menu Add To Focus or Remove From Focus.
If you want to have a specific BS or edge as a single focus use Set as Focal Point.
The eye icon highlights all elements in the Topology UI which are set to focus.
