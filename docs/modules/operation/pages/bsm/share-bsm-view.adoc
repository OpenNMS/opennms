= Share View

In some cases it is useful to share a specific view on a business service hierarchy.
For this reason you can use the Share menu function to generate a link for the current view and copy and send it to another user to have access to the same configured Business Service View.
In figure <<gu-bsm-share-view-image, Share Business Service View>> the Share menu item was used and a link is generated.
