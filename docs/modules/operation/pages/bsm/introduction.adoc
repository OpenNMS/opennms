= Business Service Monitoring

While {page-component-title} detects issues in your network by device, interface or service, the Business Service Monitoring (BSM) takes it one step further.
With the BSM feature, it is possible to model high-level business service contexts around the technical Service Monitors provided in {page-component-title} and quickly identify the most critical problems affecting them.
To indicate which business service is affected by events at the technical service monitors level, a business service operational status is calculated.

As an example, let's assume a company runs an online store.
Customers log in, select items, place them in the shopping cart and checkout using a payment system.
The whole service is provided by a few web servers and access data from databases.
To monitor the status of the databases, a SQL service monitor on each database server is configured.
For testing the web servers a HTTP service monitor is used for each of them.
Covering the overall functionality, a Page Sequence Monitor (PSM) tests the login, shop, and payment workflow through the provided web portal.
A possible representation of the whole system hierarchy is shown below.
