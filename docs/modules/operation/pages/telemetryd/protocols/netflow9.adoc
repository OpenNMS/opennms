[[telemetryd-netflow9-parser-udp]]
== Netflow v9 UDP Parser

The Netflow v9 UDP parser accepts packets received by a <<telemetryd/listener/udp.adoc#telemetryd-listener-udp, UDP listener>> and must forward them to a <<telemetryd-netflow9-adapter, Netflow v9 adapter>>.

The Netflow v9 UDP parser supports protocol detection.

| Parameter                     | Default    | Description
| templateTimeout               | 30 minutes | Templates must be redeclared in the given duration or they will be dropped.
| maxClockSkew                  | 0          | The maximum delta in seconds between exporter and Minion timestamps.
| clockSkewEventRate            | 3600       | Used to rate-limit clock skew events in seconds.
| dnsLookupsEnabled             | true       | Used to enable or disable DNS resolution for flows.
| sequenceNumberPatience        | 32         | A value > 1 enables checking for sequence number completeness.
                                                The value gives the size of the history buffer allowing flows to be processed out of order.
| flowActiveTimeoutFallback     | none       | Fallback value for active flow timeout, if value is not included in exported flows.
| flowInactiveTimeoutFallback   | none       | Fallback value for inactive flow timeout, if value is not included in exported flows.
| flowSamplingIntervalFallback  | none       | Fallback value for sampling interval, if value is not included in exported flows.
|===

NOTE: The parameter `maxClockSkew` in your parser definition enables clock skew detection for exporters.
It specifies the maximum delta in seconds between exporter and Minion timestamps.
If exceeded, an alarm will be generated for the exporting device.
The default value is 0, so clock skew detection is disabled.
Furthermore, you can use the `clockSkewEventRate` parameter to rate-limit clock skew events.
The default is `3600` seconds, so every hour an event will be sent.


[[telemetryd-netflow9-adapter]]
== Netflow v9 Adapter

The Netflow v9 adapter handles Netflow v9 payloads received and parsed by by the <<telemetryd-netflow9-parser-udp, Netflow v9 UDP Parser>>.
Flows are decoded from the messages into the canonical flow format and are published to the flow repository.
