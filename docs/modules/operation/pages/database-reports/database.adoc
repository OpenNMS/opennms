= Database Reports

Reporting on information from the {page-component-title} monitoring system is important for strategical or operational decisions.
Database reports give access to the embedded JasperReports engine and allow users to create and customize report templates.
Run these reports on demand or on a predefined schedule within {page-component-title}.

NOTE: Originally database reports created reports working on data stored in the {page-component-title} database only.
      This is no longer mandatory, you can also use performance data.
      Theoretically, the reports do not need to be {page-component-title} related.

NOTE: The {page-component-title} Report Engine lets you create reports and supports distributed report repositories.
         This documentation does not cover these features.
         It describes only reports using JasperReports and Grafana dashboards.

[[ga-database-reports-overview]]
== Overview

The {page-component-title} Report Engine uses the JasperReport library to create reports in various output formats.
Each report template must be a `*.jrxml` file.
The {page-component-title} Report Engine passes a JDBC connection to the {page-component-title} database to each report on execution.

// Comment: The current Jasper Reports version is 6.19.1 and these reports were written for 6.3.0, so modifying the jrxml files with the current version is very challenging.  The vast majority of the reports that I have tried with the current version do not render without at least several modifications.  Is there any plan to upgrade the Jasper Reports code?

// Comment: The apps list of database reports needs some editing.  There are inconsistencies across the descriptions and pages prompting for Report Parameters. Finally, the order of the reports seem random.

[[ga-database-report-add-custom-report]]

== Modify existing reports

All default {page-component-title} reports are located in `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/report-templates`.
Each .jrxml file located there can be modified; the changes are applied the next time {page-component-title} creates a report.

When a subreport has been modified, {page-component-title} will detect a change based on the report's `lastModified` time and will recompile the report.
A compiled version of the report is represented by a .jasper file with the same name as the .jrxml file.
Subreports are located in `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/report-templates/subreports`.

TIP: If unsure, simply delete all .jasper files and {page-component-title} will automatically compile the subreports if needed.

== Add a custom report

To add a new JasperReport report to the local {page-component-title} report repository, do the following:

Create a new entry in the `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/database-reports.xml` file.

[source, xml]
-----
<report
  id="MyReport" <1>
  display-name="My Report" <2>
  online="true" <3>
  report-service="jasperReportService" <4>
  description="This is an example description. It shows up in the web ui when creating an online report"  <5>
/>
-----
<1> A unique identifier
<2> The name of the report. Appears in the web UI.
<3> Defines if this report can be executed on demand, otherwise only scheduling is possible.
<4> The report service implementation to use. In most cases this is `jasperReportService`.
<5> A description of the report. Appears in the web UI.

In addition, create a new entry in the `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/jasper-reports.xml` file.

[source, xml]
-----
<report
  id="MyReport" <1>
  template="My-Report.jrxml" <2>
  engine="jdbc" <3>
/>
-----
<1> The identifier defined in the previous step. This identifier must exist in `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/database-reports.xml`.
<2> The name of the template. The template must be located in `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/report-templates`.
<3> The engine to use. It is either `jdbc` or `null`.

[[ga-database-reports-usage-jaspersoft-studio]]
== Jaspersoft Studio use

When developing new reports, we recommended using the Jaspersoft Studio application.
Download it link:http://community.jaspersoft.com/project/jaspersoft-studio[here].

TIP: We recommend to always use the same Jaspersoft Studio version that the {page-component-title} JasperReport library uses.
     Currently {page-component-title} uses version {jasperreportsversion}.

[[ga-database-reports-connect-database]]
=== Connect to the {page-component-title} database

To actually create SQL statements against the {page-component-title} database you must create a database Data Adapter.
The official Jaspersoft Studio documentation and wiki describe how to do this.

[[ga-database-reports-measurement-ds-helpers]]
=== Use Measurements Datasource and Helpers

To use the Measurements API you must add the Measurements Datasource library to the build path of JasperStudio.
To do so, right click in the Project Explorer and select *Configure Buildpath*.

image::database-reports/1_configure-build-path-1.png[]

. Switch to the *Libraries* tab.
. Click *Add External JARs* and select the `opennms-jasperstudio-extension-\{opennms-version}-jar-with-dependencies.jar` file located in `$OPENNMS_HOME/contrib/jasperstudio-extension`.
. Close the file selection dialog.

+
image::database-reports/2_configure-build-path-2.png[]

. The Measurements Datasource and Helpers should now be available.
. Go to the *Dataset and Query Dialog* in Jaspersoft Studio and select the "measurement" language.

image::database-reports/3_dataset-query-dialog.png[]

NOTE: If the `Read Fields` functionality is not available, use the `Data preview`.
       Use the `MEASUREMENT_URL`, `MEASUREMENT_USERNAME`, and `MEASUREMENT_PASSWORD` connection parameters to Access the Measurements API.
      See <<ga-database-reports-fields, Supported Fields>> for more details.

[[ga-database-reports-access-performance-data]]
== Accessing performance data

WARNING: Before OpenNMS Horizon 17 and OpenNMS Meridian 2016, you could access the performance data stored in .rrd or .jrobin files directly by using the jrobin language extension the RrdDataSource provides.
         This is no longer possible; you must use the Measurements Datasource.

To access performance data within reports, we created a custom Measurement Datasource that lets you query the Measurements API and process the returned data in your reports.
Please refer to the link:http://docs.opennms.org/opennms/branches/develop/guide-development/guide-development.html#_measurements_api[official Measurements API documentation] on how to use the Measurements API.

NOTE:  When using the Measurements Datasource within a report, an HTTP connection to the Measurements API is established only if the report is not running within {page-component-title}; for example, when used with Jaspersoft Studio.

To receive data from the Measurements API, create a query as follows:

.Sample queryString to receive data from the Measurements API
[source, xml]
------
<query-request step="300000" start="$P{startDateTime}" end="$P{endDateTime}" maxrows="2000"> <1>
  <source aggregation="AVERAGE" label="IfInOctets" attribute="ifHCInOctets" transient="false" resourceId="node[$P\{nodeid}].interfaceSnmp[$P{interface}]"/>
  <source aggregation="AVERAGE" label="IfOutOctets" attribute="ifHCOutOctets" transient="false" resourceId="node[$P\{nodeid}].interfaceSnmp[$P{interface}]"/>
</query-request>
------
<1> The query language. In our case, "measurement", but JasperReports supports a lot out of the box, such as sql, xpath, and so on.

[[ga-database-reports-fields]]
=== Fields

Each data source should return a number of fields, which you can use in the report.
The Measurement Datasource supports the following fields:

[options="header"]
[cols="1,3,1"]
|===
| Name
| Description
| Type


| label
| Each source defined as `transient=false` can be used as a field.
The name of the field is the label; for example, `IfInOctets`.
| java.lang.Double

| timestamp
| The timestamp of the sample.
| java.util.Date

| step
| The step size of the response. Returns the same value for all rows.
| java.lang.Long

| start
| The start timestamp in milliseconds of the response. Returns the same value for all rows.
| java.lang.Long

| end
| The end timestamp in milliseconds of the response. Returns the same value for all rows.
| java.lang.Long

|===

For more details about the response, see the link:http://docs.opennms.org/opennms/branches/develop/guide-development/guide-development.html#_measurements_api[official Measurement API documentation].

[[ga-database-reports-parameters]]
=== Parameters

In addition to the queryString, the following JasperReports parameters are supported.

[options="header"]
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Parameter name       | Description
2+| *Required*
| MEASUREMENTURL      | The URL of the Measurements API; for example, `\http://localhost:8980/opennms/rest/measurements`
2+| *Optional*
| MEASUREMENT_USERNAME | If authentication is required, specify the username; for example, "admin".
| MEASUREMENT_PASSWORD | If authentication is required, specify the password; for example, "admin"
|===

[[ga-database-reports-disable-scheduler]]
== Disable scheduler

When you need to disable the scheduler executing the reports, set the system property `opennms.report.scheduler.enabled` to false.
You can set this in a `.properties` file in the `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/opennms.properties.d/` directory.

[[ga-database-reports-helper-methods]]
== Helper methods

There are a few helper methods to help create reports in {page-component-title}.

These helpers come with the Measurement Datasource.

.Supported helper methods for the `org.opennms.netmgt.jasper.helper.MeasurementsHelper` class
[options="header"]
[cols="2,3a"]
|===
| Helper method
| Description

| getNodeOrNodeSourceDescriptor(nodeId, foreignSource, foreignId)
| Generates a node source descriptor according to the input parameters.
Either `node[nodeId]` or `nodeSource[foreignSource:foreignId]` is returned. +
`nodeSource[foreignSource:foreignId]` is returned only if `foreignSource` and `foreignId` are not empty and not null.
Otherwise, `node[nodeId]` is returned.

* *nodeId*: String, the ID of the node.
* *foreignSource*: String, the foreign source of the node. May be null.
* *foreignId*: String, the foreign ID of the node. May be null.

For more details, see <<ga-database-reports-node-source-descriptor, Node source descriptor use>>.

| getInterfaceDescriptor(snmpifname, snmpifdescr, snmpphysaddr)
| Returns the interface descriptor of a given interface; for example, `en0-005e607e9e00`.
The input parameters are prioritized. +
If an `snmpifdescr` is specified, it is used instead of the `snmpifname`. +
If an `snmpphysaddr` is defined, it will be appended to `snmpifname`/`snmpifdescr`.

* *snmpifname*: String, the interface name of the interface; for example, `en0`. May be null.
* *snmpifdescr*: String, the description of the interface; for example, `en0`. May be null.
* *snmpphysaddr*: String, the MAC address of the interface; for example, `005e607e9e00`. May be null.
As each input parameter may be null, not all of them can be null at the same time. At least one input parameter has to be defined.

For more details, see <<ga-database-reports-interface-descriptor, Interface descriptor use>>.
|===

[[ga-database-reports-node-source-descriptor]]
=== Node source descriptor use

A node is addressed by a node source descriptor.
The node source descriptor references the node either via the foreign source and foreign id or by the node id.

If `storeByForeignSource` is enabled, it is only possible to address the node via foreign source and foreign id.

To make report creation easier, there is a helper method to create the node source descriptor.

NOTE: For more information, see https://opennms.discourse.group/t/storing-data-with-foreign-sources/2057[Storing data with foreign sources] on Discourse.

The following example shows the use of that helper.

.jrxml report snippet to visualize the use of the node source descriptor.
[source, xml]
------
<parameter name="nodeResourceDescriptor" class="java.lang.String" isForPrompting="false">
  <defaultValueExpression><![CDATA[org.opennms.netmgt.jasper.helper.MeasurementsHelper.getNodeOrNodeSourceDescriptor(String.valueOf($P{nodeid}), $Pforeignsource, $P{foreignid})]]></defaultValueExpression>
</parameter>
<queryString language="Measurement">
  <![CDATA[<query-request step="300000" start="$P{startDateTime}" end="$P{endDateTime}" maxrows="2000">
<source aggregation="AVERAGE" label="IfInOctets" attribute="ifHCInOctets" transient="false" resourceId="$P{nodeResourceDescriptor}.interfaceSnmp[en0-005e607e9e00]"/>
<source aggregation="AVERAGE" label="IfOutOctets" attribute="ifHCOutOctets" transient="false" resourceId="$P{nodeResourceDescriptor}.interfaceSnmp[en0-005e607e9e00]"/>
</query-request>]]>
------
Depending on the input parameters, you get either a node resource descriptor or a foreign source/foreign id resource descriptor.

[[ga-database-reports-interface-descriptor]]
=== Interface descriptor use

An interfaceSnmp is addressed with the exact interface descriptor.
To allow easy access to the interface descriptor, we provide a helper tool.
The following example shows the use of that helper.

.jrxml report snippet to visualize the use of the interface descriptor
[source, xml]
------
<parameter name="interface" class="java.lang.String" isForPrompting="false">
  <parameterDescription><![CDATA[]]></parameterDescription>
  <defaultValueExpression><![CDATA[org.opennms.netmgt.jasper.helper.MeasurementsHelper.getInterfaceDescriptor($P{snmpifname}, $P{snmpifdescr}, $P{snmpphysaddr})]]></defaultValueExpression>
</parameter>
<queryString language="Measurement">
  <![CDATA[<query-request step="300000" start="$P{startDateTime}" end="$P{endDateTime}" maxrows="2000">
<source aggregation="AVERAGE" label="IfInOctets" attribute="ifHCInOctets" transient="false" resourceId="node[$P{nodeid}].interfaceSnmp[$P{interface}]"/>
<source aggregation="AVERAGE" label="IfOutOctets" attribute="ifHCOutOctets" transient="false" resourceId="node[$P{nodeid}].interfaceSnmp[$P{interface}]"/>
</query-request>]]>
------

To get the appropriate interface descriptor depends on the input parameter.

[[ga-database-reports-https]]
=== HTTPS use

To establish a secure connection to the Measurements API, you must import the public certificate of the running {page-component-title} to the Java Truststore.
In addition, you must configure {page-component-title} to use that Java Truststore.
Please follow the instructions in this <<admin/http-ssl.adoc#ga-operation-ssl-opennms-trust-store,chapter>> to set up the Java Truststore correctly.

In addition, set the property `org.opennms.netmgt.jasper.measurement.ssl.enable` in `$OPENNMS_HOME\etc\opennms.properties` to "true" to ensure that only secure connections are established.

WARNING: If `org.opennms.netmgt.jasper.measurement.ssl.enable` is set to "false", an accidentally insecure connection can be established to the Measurements API location.
An SSL-secured connection can be established even if `org.opennms.netmgt.jasper.measurement.ssl.enable` is set to "false".

[[ga-database-reports-limitations]]
== Limitations

 * Only a JDBC Datasource to the {page-component-title} database connection can be passed to a report, or no datasource at all.
One does not have to use the data source, though.
