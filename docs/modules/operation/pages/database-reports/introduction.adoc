= Database Reports

Reporting on information from the {page-component-title} monitoring system is important for strategical or operational decisions.
Database reports give access to the embedded JasperReports engine and allow users to create and customize report templates.
Run these reports on demand or on a predefined schedule within {page-component-title}.

NOTE: Originally database reports created reports working on data stored in the {page-component-title} database only.
      This is no longer mandatory, you can also use performance data.
      Theoretically, the reports do not need to be {page-component-title} related.

NOTE: The {page-component-title} Report Engine lets you create reports and supports distributed report repositories.
         This documentation does not cover these features.
         It describes only reports using JasperReports and Grafana dashboards.
