== Modify existing reports

All default {page-component-title} reports are located in `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/report-templates`.
Each .jrxml file located there can be modified; the changes are applied the next time {page-component-title} creates a report.

When a subreport has been modified, {page-component-title} will detect a change based on the report's `lastModified` time and will recompile the report.
A compiled version of the report is represented by a .jasper file with the same name as the .jrxml file.
Subreports are located in `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/report-templates/subreports`.

TIP: If unsure, simply delete all .jasper files and {page-component-title} will automatically compile the subreports if needed.
