== Creating PDF reports from Grafana dashboards using {page-component-title}

{page-component-title} provides three templates to create a PDF report from an existing Grafana dashboard.
You can also schedule and email these PDF reports to anyone:

* Keep staff without access to {page-component-title} informed about network performance for improved capacity planning
* Create a permanent record of strategic information and progress over a long period of time

The PDF report displays each of the panels from the specified dashboard, with one, two, or four panels per page, depending on the selected template.

=== Before you begin

This feature requires {page-component-title} and an instance of Grafana with at least one dashboard and panel.
OpenNMS lets you create a report for any Grafana dashboard, not just those created using link:http://docs.opennms.org/helm/branches/master/helm/latest/welcome/index.html[OpenNMS Helm].

You must set up Grafana as a data source by xref:grafana-endpoint[configuring the Grafana endpoint] in {page-component-title}.
