= Default Calendar Report

Standard OpenNMS report in calendar format.


// ToDo: The contents of this report are exactly the same as the "Classic" report with the only exception being that table 2 and table 3 are replaced with calendars with day on the calendar having the corresponding data from the row of the corresponding table in the Classic Report.  I can either make that reference and explain the difference or I can copy and past the text from the Classic report and make the edit here.  I believe the latter approach would be better.
