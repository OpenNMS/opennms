= Interface Availability Report


This report shows interface availability for interfaces with outages within the time range.
It is a multi-page report that provides the following availability data for all router interfaces by IP address over the user-specified date range:

* Number of outages
* Mean Time To Repair ("MTTR") (in hours)
* Length of time for each outage (in hours)
* Percent outage (per unit in category)
* Percent availability (per unit in category)

//QUESTION: Need to validate explanation of the last two, in the summary chart at the end, are these averages over the entire period or per day?

This report can be customized with a company logo (approximately 195px by 50px) in both the header and footer.
