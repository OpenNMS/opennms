= Maintenance Contracts Strategy Report

This assessment management report assistd in creating and reviewing a network management maintenance strategy.
This report has a pie chart showing the number of assets in the various contract states (for example, active contract, expired contract, no contract, etc.).
//QUESTION: confirm these are the correct slices.  It is not clear from the SQL query.  I think there are only three states but the sample pie chart shows five slices.

The next chart is a stacked bar chart and groups the assets by their age and shows the number of assets in each age group that have an active contract, an expired contract, or no contract.

The last chart is a stacked bar chart that breaks the assets down by age groups and shows the number of assets in each group that have active contracts that are valid for the next twelve months and assets whose contract expires in the next twelve months.
//QUESTION: Is "asset" the right noun.

// COMMENT: The text in the app under this report title has a couple of typos in it.  It should probably be rewritten to be a little more clear.
// COMMENT: The text on the report also needs to be edited.
You can customize this report with a company logo (approximately 195px by 50px) in the page header.

| Field
| Type
| Description
| Default

| Date Format
| String
| Specify the date format in the maintenance contracts date fields.
| YYYY-MM-DD
// QUESTION: Not sure why this is here.  Shouldn't the expiration date be stored as a date field?  If so, format is not necessary, unless it is for output.  If it is an output format preference, it should be a more generic parameter.  If all the dates in the maintenance contracts have different formats, then this will be problematic.
