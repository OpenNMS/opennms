[[grafana-report]]
= Grafana Dashboard Reports


{page-component-title} provides three templates to create a PDF report from an existing Grafana dashboard.
You can also schedule and email these PDF reports to anyone:

* Keep staff without access to {page-component-title} informed about network performance for improved capacity planning
* Create a permanent record of strategic information and progress over a long period of time

The PDF report displays each of the panels from the specified dashboard, with one, two, or four panels per page, depending on the selected template.

== Before you begin

This feature requires {page-component-title} and an instance of Grafana with at least one dashboard and panel.
OpenNMS lets you create a report for any Grafana dashboard, not just those created using link:http://docs.opennms.org/helm/branches/master/helm/latest/welcome/index.html[OpenNMS Helm].

You must set up Grafana as a data source by xref:grafana-endpoint[configuring the Grafana endpoint] in {page-component-title}.

If you are using the Docker image for Grafana, you must complete additional configuration.
Refer to Grafana's https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/image_rendering/#remote-rendering-service[Remote rendering service documentation] for more information on how to set up remote rendering.
Additional details are available on https://github.com/grafana/grafana-image-renderer/blob/master/docs/remote_rendering_using_docker.md[GitHub].
