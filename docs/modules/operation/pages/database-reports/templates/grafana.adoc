== Create PDF reports from Grafana dashboards using {page-component-title}

{page-component-title} provides three templates to create a PDF report from an existing Grafana dashboard.
You can also schedule and email these PDF reports to anyone:

* Keep staff without access to {page-component-title} informed about network performance for improved capacity planning
* Create a permanent record of strategic information and progress over a long period of time

The PDF report displays each of the panels from the specified dashboard, with one, two, or four panels per page, depending on the selected template.

Dashboard to PDF:

== Before you begin

This feature requires {page-component-title} and an instance of Grafana with at least one dashboard and panel.
OpenNMS lets you create a report for any Grafana dashboard, not just those created using link:http://docs.opennms.org/helm/branches/master/helm/latest/welcome/index.html[OpenNMS Helm].

You must set up Grafana as a data source by xref:grafana-endpoint[configuring the Grafana endpoint] in {page-component-title}.

If you are using the Docker image for Grafana, you must complete additional configuration.
Refer to Grafana's https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/image_rendering/#remote-rendering-service[Remote rendering service documentation] for more information on how to set up remote rendering.
Additional details are available on https://github.com/grafana/grafana-image-renderer/blob/master/docs/remote_rendering_using_docker.md[GitHub].

. Choose menu:Configuration[API Keys New API Key].
. Specify a key name and "Viewer" role and click *Add*.
.. Leave the time to live blank so that the key never expires.
