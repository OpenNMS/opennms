= Write the Docs

This document is the guideline for people who wish to contribute to writing documentation for the _{product-title}_.
The software is free and open source, contribution of any kind is welcome.
We ask that you observe the rules and guidelines outlined here to maintain consistency across the project.

The chosen file format for documentation is AsciiDoc (http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc[Asciidoc Homepage]).
Document files use the `.adoc` file extension.

Note that there are different ways to contribute documentation, each suitable for the different use cases:

* Tutorials and How To's which are not directly tight to a specific version of _{product-title}_ should be published on the http://wiki.opennms.org[OpenNMS Wiki].
  For example: you want to describe how to use the Net-SNMP agent and the SNMP monitor from _{product-title}_ to solve a special use case.

* The documentation in the source code should be formal technical documentation.
  The writing style should be accurate and concise.
  However, ensure that you explain concepts in detail and do not make omissions.

[[gd-docs-file-structure]]
== File Structure in docs

[options="header", cols="e,d"]
|===
| Directory         | Contents
| `_images/`        | AsciiBinder related images for rendering, for example the logo
| `_javascripts/`   | JavaScript libraries used for the rendering
| `_package/`       | Directory which is not under version control and is created when `asciibinder package` is used to generate the docs
| `_preview/`       | Directory which is not under version control and is created when `asciibinder build` is used to generate a preview of the docs
| `_stylesheets/`   | Directory with stylesheets used for the rendering
| `_templates/`     | Templates for HTML rendering
| `_distro_map.yml` | Describes the overall documentation structure for _{product-title}_ and the Minion
| `_topic_map.yml`  | Describes which and how the specific parts of the documentation are build
|===

All other directories contain the `.adoc` files and directories with images.
For further instruction please see the xref:how-to-build-docs#[How To Build the Docs] section in this documentation.

[[doc-guidelines-images]]
=== Include images

When visualizing complex problems you can help the explanation and provide greater information by using an image.
We use in OpenNMS documentation modules two directories for images.

The image folder structure mirrors the text structure.
In this case it is a little bit easier to locate the AsciiDoc text file where the image is included.

.Example folder structure for image files
[source]
----
.
└── docs<1>
    └── alarms<2>
        ├── images<3>
        |   ├── 01_alarm-notes_raw.png<4>
        |   └── 01_alarm_notes.png
        ├── alarm-notes.adoc<5>
        ├── alarm-sound-flash.adoc
        └── amqp-alarm-northbounder.adoc

----

<1> This folder contains the documentation
<2> The directory with the generic topic
<3> Directory with images
<4> The original unmodified image
<5> Image which is modified or enriched with markups and used in the documentation

To include an image file, the following procedure can be followed as a best practice:

.First included image
[source]
----
.This is a caption of the image
image::02_opennms-logo.png[]
----

Which is rendered as:

.This is a caption of the image
image::02_opennms-logo.png[]

In the beginning of the `.adoc` file you can add, which allows to use all image file names directly.
It also enables GitHub to lookup images in the folder and can preview those images when you open the `.adoc` file in GitHub correctly.

[source]
----
// Allow GitHub image rendering
:imagesdir: ./images
----

[[gd-docs-include-source]]
== Code Snippets

You can include code snippets, configuration- or source code files in the documentation.
You can enable syntax highlighting by providing the given language parameter, this will work on source code or configuration.

[[gd-docs-explicit]]
=== Explicitly defined in the document

WARNING: be careful to use this kind of code snippets as sparsely as possible.
Code becomes obsolete very quickly, archaic usage practices are detrimental.

if you do wish to include snippets use the following method:

.This is a sample configuration explicitly in the documentation
[source,xml]
----
<service name="DNS" interval="300000" user-defined="false" status="on">
  <parameter key="retry" value="2" />
  <parameter key="timeout" value="5000" />
  <parameter key="port" value="53" />
  <parameter key="lookup" value="localhost" />
  <parameter key="fatal-response-codes" value="2,3,5" /><!-- ServFail, NXDomain, Refused -->
  <parameter key="rrd-repository" value="/opt/opennms/share/rrd/response" />
  <parameter key="rrd-base-name" value="dns" />
  <parameter key="ds-name" value="dns" />
</service>
----

If there's no suitable syntax highlighter for the code used just omit the language: +[source]+.

Currently the following syntax highlighters are enabled:

* Bash
* Groovy
* Java
* JavaScript
* Python
* XML

For other highlighters that could be added see https://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/.

[[gd-docs-include]]
=== Included from an example file

You can include source or configuration from an external file.
In this way you can provide a working example configuration maintaining doc and example at the same time.
The procedure and rules are the same as with images, the path is relative to the *.adoc file where the file to be used is included.

.Include complete external file
 [source,xml]
 ----
 include::./dev-env-opennms/configs/wmi-config.xml[]
 ----

This is how it's rendered:

[source,xml]
----
include::./dev-env-opennms/configs/wmi-config.xml[]
----

[[gd-docs-include-parts]]
=== Include parts of a file

If you want to include just a specific segment of a large configuration file, you can assign tags that indicate to AsciiDoc the section that is to be included.
In this example just the service definition of the _ICMP monitor_ should be included.

In the 'poller-configuration.xml' tag the section in the following manner:

[source,xml]
----
...
<rrd step="300">
  <rra>RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1:2016</rra>
  <rra>RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:12:1488</rra>
  <rra>RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:288:366</rra>
  <rra>RRA:MAX:0.5:288:366</rra>
  <rra>RRA:MIN:0.5:288:366</rra>
</rrd>
<!-- # tag::IcmpServiceConfig[] -->
<service name="ICMP" interval="300000" user-defined="false" status="on">
  <parameter key="retry" value="2" />
  <parameter key="timeout" value="3000" />
  <parameter key="rrd-repository" value="/opt/opennms/share/rrd/response" />
  <parameter key="rrd-base-name" value="icmp" />
  <parameter key="ds-name" value="icmp" />
</service>
<!-- # end::IcmpServiceConfig[] -->
<service name="DNS" interval="300000" user-defined="false" status="on">
  <parameter key="retry" value="2" />
  <parameter key="timeout" value="5000" />
  <parameter key="port" value="53" />
...
----

.Include this tagged part in the documentation using the _tag_ parameter
 [source,xml]
 ----
 include::./dev-env-opennms/configs/poller-configuration.xml[tags=IcmpServiceConfig]
 ----

.This is how it rendered
[source,xml]
include::./dev-env-opennms/configs/poller-configuration.xml[tags=IcmpServiceConfig]

NOTE: Spaces and tabs are taken from the original file.

[[gd-docs-writing]]
== Writing
The following rules will help you to commit correctly formatted and prepared documentation for inclusion in the OpenNMS project.
It is important that we maintain a level of consistency across all of our committers and the documentation they produce.

When writing place a single sentence on each line.
This makes it easy to move content around, and also easy to spot long, or fragmented, sentences.
This will also allow us to assign comments on a sentence in GitHub which will facilitate easier merging.

NOTE: Other than writing documentation, you can help out by providing comments on documentation, reviewing, suggesting improvements or reporting bugs.
To do this head over to: http://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS/component/10011[issue tracker for documentation]!

[[gd-docs-conventions]]
=== Conventions for text formatting

The following conventions are used:

* File names and path are written in \`poller-configuration.xml` they will be rendered in: `poller-configuration.xml`;
* Names that indicate special attention, e.g. this configuration matches \*any* entry: this is rendered as: this configuration matches *any* entry;
* \_Italics_ is rendered as _Italics_ and used for emphasis and indicate internal names and abbreviations;
* \*Bold* is rendered as *Bold* and should be used sparingly, for strong emphasis only;
* \+methodName()+ is rendered as +methodName()+ and is also used for literals,
  (note: the content between the `+` signs _will_ be parsed);
* \`command` is rendered as `command` (typically used for command-line or parts used in configuration files),
  (note: the content between the +`+ signs _will not_ be parsed);
* \`my/path/` is rendered as `my/path/` this is used for file names and paths;
* \\``double quote'' (which is two grave accents to the left and two acute accents to the right) renders as ``double quote'';
* \`single quote' (which is a single grave accent to the left and a single acute accent to the right) renders as `single quote'.

[[gd-docs-gotchas]]
=== Gotchas

* Always leave a blank line at the top of the documents section.
  It might be the title ends up in the last paragraph of the document;

* Start in line 2 setting a relative path to the images directory to picture rendering on GitHub:

[source]
----
// Allow image rendering
:imagesdir: relative/path/to/images/dir
----

* Always leave a blank line at the end of documents;
* As +{}+ are used for Asciidoc attributes, everything inside will be treated as an attribute.
  To avoid this you have to escape the opening brace: +\\{+.
  If you do not escape the opening brace, the braces and the text inside them will be removed without any warning being issued!;
* Forcing line breaks can be achieved with ` +` at the end of the line followed by a line break.

.Example in source force line break
[source]
----
This is the first line +
and this a forced 2nd line
----

.Rendered output with forced line break
This is the first line +
and this a forced 2nd line

[[gd-docs-structure]]
== Headings and document structure

Each document starts over with headings from level zero (the document title).
Each document should have an id.
In some cases sections in the document need to have id's as well, this depends on where they fit in the overall structure.
If you wish to have a link to specific content that content has to have an id.
A missing id in a mandatory place will cause the build to fail.

To start a document:

[source]
----
[[unique-id-verbose-is-ok]]
= The Document Title
----

If you are including the document inside another document and you need to push the headings down to the right level in the output, the +leveloffset+ attribute is used.

Subsequent headings in a document should use the following syntax:

[source]
----
== Subheading

... content here ...

=== Subsubheading

content here ...

----

[[gd-docs-links]]
== Links

When you need to link to other parts of the manual you use the target id.
To use a target id you follow this syntax:

[source]
----
<<doc-guidelines-links>>
----

This will render as: <<doc-guidelines-links>>

NOTE: To use the target id in you document simply write the target id in your text, for example:

see \<<target-id>>

this should suffice for most cases.

If you need to link to another document with your own link text, then follow this procedure:

[source]
----
<<target-id, link text that fits in the context>>
----

NOTE: Having lots of linked text may work well in a web context but is a distracting in print.
      The documentation we are creating is intended for both mediums so be considerate of this in your usage.

If you wish to use an external link, they are are added as:

[source]
----
http://www.opennms.org/[Link text here]
----

This will render in the output as: http://www.opennms.org/[Link text here]

For short links it may be beneficial not to use accompanying link text:

[source]
----
http://www.opennms.org/
----

Which renders as: http://www.opennms.org/

NOTE: It is acceptable to have a period trailing after the URL, it will not render as a part of the link.

[[doc-guideline-admonitions-notes]]
== Admonitions and useful notes

These are useful for defining specific sections, such as Notes, Tips and Important information.
We encourage the use of them in the documentation as long as they are used appropriately.
Choose from the following:

.Source template for making a note for additional hints
[source]
----
NOTE: This is my note.
----

This is how its rendered:

NOTE: This is my note.

.Source for giving a tip
[source]
----
TIP: This is my tip.
----

This is how its rendered:

TIP: This is my tip.

.Source for giving a important hint
[source]
----
IMPORTANT: This is my important hint.
----

This is how its rendered:

IMPORTANT: This is my important hint.

.Source for giving a caution
[source]
----
CAUTION: This is my caution.
----

This is how its rendered:

CAUTION: This is my caution.

.Source for giving a warning
[source]
----
WARNING: This is my warning.
----

This is how its rendered:

WARNING: This is my warning.

A multiline variation:

[source]
----
TIP: Tiptext. +
     Line 2.
----

Which is rendered as:

TIP: Tiptext. +
     Line 2.

NOTE: Remember to write these in full caps. There is no easy manner in which to add new admonitions, do not create your own.

[[gd-docs-attributes]]
== Attributes

Common attributes you can use in documents:

* \{opennms-version} - rendered as "{opennms-version}"

These can substitute part of URLs that point to, for example, APIdocs or source code.
Note that opennms-git-tag also handles the case of snapshot/master.

Sample Asciidoc attributes which can be used:

* \{docdir} - root directory of the documents
* \{nbsp} - non-breaking space

[[gd-docs-comments]]
== Comments
There's a separate build that includes comments.
When the comments are used they show up with a yellow background.
This build doesn't run by default, but after a normal build, you can use `make annotated` to create a build yourself.
You can use the resulting 'annotated' page to search for content as the full manual is a single page.

To write a comment:

[source]
----
// this is a comment
----

Comments are not visible in the standard build.
Comment blocks won't be included in the output of any build.
The syntax for a comment block is:

[source]
----
////
Note that includes in here will still be processed, but not make it into the output.
That is, missing includes here will still break the build!
////
----

[[gd-docs-tables]]
== Tables

For representing structured information you can use tables.
A table is constructed in the following manner:

[source]
----
[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Parameter     | Description                | Required | Default value
| `myFirstParm` | my first long description  | required | `myDefault`
| `myScndParm`  | my second long description | required | `myDefault`
|===
----

This is rendered as:

[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Parameter     | Description                | Required | Default value
| `myFirstParm` | my first long description  | required | `myDefault`
| `myScndParm`  | my second long description | required | `myDefault`
|===

NOTE: Please align your columns in the AsciiDoc source in order to give better readability when editing in text view.
      If you have a very long description, break at 120 characters and align the text to improve source readability.

.Example in AsciiDoc source for very long table descriptions
image::01_long-table-formatting.png[]

this is rendered as:

[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
| Parameter              | Description                                                                                 | Required | Default value
| `basic-authentication` | Authentication credentials to perform basic authentication.
                           Credentials should comply to http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1945.txt[RFC1945] section 11.1,
                           without the Base64 encoding part. That's: be a string made of the concatenation of: +
                           1- the user ID; +
                           2- a colon; +
                           3- the password. +
                          `basic-authentication` takes precedence over the `user` and `password` parameters.           | optional | `-`
| `header[0-9]+`         | Additional headers to be sent along with the request. Example of valid parameter's names are
                           `header0`, `header1` and `header180`. `header` is *not* a valid parameter name.             | optional | `-`
|===
