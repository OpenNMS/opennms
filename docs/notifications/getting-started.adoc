= Getting Started

The status of notifications is indicated by an icon at the top right of the web UI's navigation bar.
_{product-title}_ installs with notifications globally disabled by default.

== Enabling Notifications

To enable notifications in _{product-title}_, log in to the web UI as a user with administrator privileges. Hover over the user icon and click the _Configure OpenNMS_ link.
The controls for global notification status appear in the top-level configuration menu as _Notification Status_.
Click the _On_ radio button and then the _Update_ button.
Notifications are now globally enabled.

This configuration file change is picked up on the fly with no need to restart or send an event.

Changes to this file are picked up on the fly with no need to restart or send an event.
