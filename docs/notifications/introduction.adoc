Common notification methods are email and paging, but notification mechanisms also exist for:

* Arbitrary HTTP GET and POST operations

* Asterisk call origination
* IRCcat Internet Relay Chat bot
* SNMP Traps
* Slack, Mattermost, and other API-compatible team chat platforms
* Twitter, GNU Social, and other API-compatible microblog services

The notification daemon _Notifd_ creates and sends notifications according to configured rules when selected events occur in _{product-title}_.
