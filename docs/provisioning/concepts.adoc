_Provisioning_ is a term that is familiar to service providers (a.k.a. operators, a.k.a. telephone companies) and OSS systems but not so much in the non OSS enterprises.

Provisiond receives "requests" for adding managed entities via 2 basic mechanisms, the _{product-title}_ traditional "New Suspect" event, typically via the _Discovery daemon_, and the import requisition (XML definition of node entities) typically via the Provisioning Groups UI.
If you are familiar with all previous releases of OpenNMS, you will recognize the _New Suspect Event_ based _Discovery_ to be what was previously the _Capsd_ component of the auto discovery behavior.
You will also recognize the import requisition to be of the _Model Importer_ component of OpenNMS.
_Provisiond_ now unifies these two separate components into a massively parallel advanced policy based provisioning service.
