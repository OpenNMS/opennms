= Adapters

The _{product-title}_ _Provisiond API_ also supports _Provisioning Adapters_ (plugins) for integration with external systems during the provisioning Import phase.
When node entities are added, updated, deleted, or receive a configuration management change event, _{product-title}_ will call the adapter for the provisioning activities with integrated systems.

Currently, _{product-title}_ supports the following adapters:

== DDNS Adapter

The Opposite end of _Provisiond_ integration from the DNS Requisition Import, is the _DDNS adapter_.
This adapter uses the _dynamic DNS protocol_ to update a DNS system as nodes are provisioned into _{product-title}_.
To configure this adapter, edit the `opennms.properties` file and set the `importer.adapter.dns.server property`:

 importer.adapter.dns.server=192.168.1.1

== RANCID Adapter

Integration has been integrated with RANCID though this new API.
