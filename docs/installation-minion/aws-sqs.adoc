= Using AWS SQS

By default, _{product-title}_ uses an _ActiveMQ_ broker to communicate with _Minions_.
This broker is used for both issuing remote procedure calls (RPCs, ie. ping this host) and for transporting unsolicited messages such as SNMP traps and syslog messages.

_AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS)_ can be used as an alternative to _ActiveMQ_ for transporting the unsolicited messages.

WARNING: _AWS SQS_ cannot currently be used for handling RPC messages.
This means that _ActiveMQ_ is still required even when _AWS SQS_ support is enabled.

_AWS SQS_ must be enabled on both _{product-title}_ and _Minion_ to function.

== {product-title} Configuration

Enable and configure the _AWS SQS_ on _{opennms-product-name}_ by using the following commands.
The `initialSleepTime` property will ensure that messages are not consumed from _AWS SQS_ until the _{opennms-product-name}_ system has fully initialized.

[source, sh]
----
echo 'org.opennms.core.ipc.rpc.strategy=sqs
org.opennms.core.ipc.sink.strategy=sqs
org.opennms.core.ipc.sink.initialSleepTime=60000
org.opennms.core.ipc.aws.sqs.aws_region=us-east-1' > "$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/opennms.properties.d/aws-sqs.properties"
----

AWS Credentials are required in order to access SQS.
The default credential provider chain looks for credentials in this order:

* Environment Variables (i.e. `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`)
* Java system properties (i.e. `aws.accessKeyId` and `aws.secretKey`. These keys can be added to `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/opennms.conf`)
* Default credential profiles file (i.e. `~/.aws/credentials`)
* Amazon ECS container credentials (i.e. `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI`)
* Instance profile credentials (i.e. through the metadata service when running on EC2)

Alternatively, the credentials can be specified inside the `aws-sqs.properties` file:

[source, sh]
----
echo 'org.opennms.core.ipc.aws.sqs.aws_access_key_id=XXXXXXXXXXX
org.opennms.core.ipc.aws.sqs.aws_secret_access_key=XXXXXXXXXXX' >> "$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/opennms.properties.d/aws-sqs.properties"
----

When running OpenNMS inside AWS, it is possible to use the default provider chain with an IAM Role to avoid hard coding the AWS Credentials on a configuration file.
The following shows an example of the role that should be associated with the EC2 instance on which OpenNMS is going to run:

If you require consistent ordering of the messages, you should use FIFO queues instead of Standard queues.
You can enable FIFO queues by adding the following parameter to the `aws-sqs.properties` file referenced above:

[source, sh]
----
org.opennms.core.ipc.aws.sqs.sink.FifoQueue=true
----

Restart _{product-title}_ to apply the changes.

== Minion Configuration

Enable the _AWS SQS_ on _Minion_ using:

[source, sh]
----
echo '!minion-jms
!opennms-core-ipc-rpc-jms
!opennms-core-ipc-sink-camel
opennms-core-ipc-rpc-aws-sqs
opennms-core-ipc-sink-aws-sqs' > "$MINION_HOME/etc/featuresBoot.d/aws-sqs.boot"
----

NOTE: The snippet above prevents the default JMS related features from starting and loads the SQS related features instead.

Next, configure _AWS SQS_ on _Minion_ using:

[source, sh]
----
echo 'aws_region=us-east-1
aws_access_key_id=XXXXXXXXXXX
aws_secret_access_key=XXXXXXXXXXX' > "$MINION_HOME/etc/org.opennms.core.ipc.aws.sqs.cfg"
----

The AWS credentials are required.
If they are not specified on the configuration file, the default credentials provider chain (explained above) will be used instead.

If you require consistent ordering to the messages, you should use FIFO queues instead of Standard queues.
You can enable FIFO queues by adding the following parameter to the `org.opennms.core.ipc.aws.sqs.cfg` file referenced above:

[source, sh]
----
sink.FifoQueue=true
----

Restart _Minion_ to apply the changes.

NOTE: AWS credentials are required when the Minion is not running inside a VPC.

IMPORTANT: The settings must match what OpenNMS currently has.

== SQS Configuration Settings

From the link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_SetQueueAttributes.html[Amazon SQS Documentation], the following parameters can be added to either Minion or _{opennms-product-name}_.

* `DelaySeconds` (defaults to 0 seconds)
* `MaximumMessageSize` (defaults to 262144 bytes)
* `MessageRetentionPeriod` (defaults to 1209600 seconds)
* `ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds` (defaults to 10 seconds for OpenNMS)
* `VisibilityTimeout` (defaults to 30 seconds)
* `Policy`
* `RedrivePolicy`
* `KmsMasterKeyId`
* `KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds`

For FIFO Queues:

* `ContentBasedDeduplication` (defaults to false)

NOTE: When FIFO queues are not required, there is no need to add `FifoQueue=false` to the configuration files, as this is the default behavior.

== Managing Multiple Environments

In order to support multiple _{opennms-product-name}_ environments in a single AWS region, the `aws_queue_name_prefix` property can be used to prefix the queue names.

For example, if we set this property to be "PROD", the queue names will resemble `PROD-OpenNMS-Sink-Heartbeat`, instead of `OpenNMS-Sink-Heartbeat`.

WARNING: This property must be properly configured at  _{product-title}_  and Minion side.

== AWS Credentials

The credentials (a.k.a. the Access Key ID and the Secret Access Key) are required in both sides, OpenNMS and Minion.

In order to create credentials just for accessing SQS resources, follow this procedure:

* From the AWS Console, choose the appropriate region.
* Open the IAM Dashboard and click on "Add user".
* Choose a name for the user, for example `opennms-minion`.
* Check only `Programmatic access` for the Access type.
* On the permissions, click on `Attach existing policies directly`.
* On the search bar, write SQS, and then check on `AmazonSQSFullAccess`.
* Click on Create User

Finally, either click on Download .csv or click on "Show" to grab a copy of the Access key ID, and the Secret access key.

== Limitations

There are a number of limitations when using _AWS SQS_, in particular:

* A message can include only XML, JSON, and unformatted text. The following Unicode characters are allowed: `#x9` | `#xA` | `#xD` | `#x20` to `#xD7FF` | `#xE000` to `#xFFFD` | `#x10000` to `#x10FFFF`. Any characters not included in this list are rejected.
* The minimum message size is 1 byte (1 character). The maximum is 262,144 bytes (256 KB).
* Without batching, FIFO queues can support up to 300 messages per second (300 send, receive, or delete operations per second).

See link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-limits.html[Amazon SQS Limits] for further details.

=== Location names

Queue names in _AWS SQS_ are limited to 80 characters.
When issuing remote procedure calls, the target location is used a part of the queue name.
For this reason, it is important that:

* The length of the location name and queue name prefix (if used) must not exceed 32 characters in aggregate.
* Both the location name and queue name prefix (if used) may only contain alphanumeric characters, hyphens (-), and underscores (_).
