= Packaging

This sections describes packages for _Minion_ features and helps developers add new features to these packages.

We currently provide two different feature packages for _Minion_:

openns-minion-features-core::
Core utilities and services required for connectivity with the _OpenNMS_ controller

openns-minion-features-default::
Minion-specific service extensions

Every package bundles all of the Karaf Feature Files and Maven Dependencies into a Maven Repository with additional meta-data used by the `KarafExtender`.

== Adding a new feature to the default feature package

. Add the feature definition to `container/features/src/main/resources/features-minion.xml`.
. Add the feature name in the `features` list configuration for the `features-maven-plugin` in `features/minion/repository/pom.xml`.
. Optionally add the feature name to `features/minion/repository/src/main/resources/features.boot` if the feature should be automatically installed when the container is started.
