= Minion Develop

This guide is intended to help developers get started with writing _Minion_ related features.
It is not intended to be an exhaustive overview of the _Minion_ architecture or feature set.

== Karaf Container

This section details the customizations we make to the standard _Karaf_ distribution for the _Minion_ container.

=== Clean Start

We clear the cache on every start by setting `karaf.clean.cache = true` in order to ensure that only the features listed in the featuresBoot (or installed by the `karaf-extender`) are installed.

=== Karaf Extender

The _Karaf Extender_ was developed to make it easier to manage and extend the container using existing packaging tools.
It allows packages to register *Maven Repositories*, *Karaf Feature Repositories* and *Karaf Features to Boot* by overlaying additional files, avoiding modifying any of the existing files.

Here's an overview, used for reference, of the relevant directories that are (currently) present on a default install of the `opennms-minion` package:
[source, shell]
----
├── etc
│   └── featuresBoot.d
│       └── custom.boot
├── repositories
│   ├── .local
│   ├── core
│   │   ├── features.uris
│   │   └── features.boot
│   └── default
│       ├── features.uris
│       └── features.boot
└── system
----

When the `karaf-extender` feature is installed it will:

. Find all of the folders listed under `$karaf.home/repositories` that do not start with a '.' and sort these by name.
. Gather the list of Karaf Feature Repository URIs from the `features.uris` files in the repositories.
. Gather the list of Karaf Feature Names from the `features.boot` files in the repositories.
. Gather the list of Karaf Feature Names form the files under `$karaf.etc/featuresBoot.d` that do not start with a '.' and sort these by name.
. Register the Maven Repositories by updating the `org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.repositories` key for the PID `org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn`.
. Wait up to 30 seconds until all of the Karaf Feature URIs are resolvable (the Maven Repositiries may take a few moments to update after updating the configuration.)
. Install the Karaf Feature Repository URIs.
. Install the Karaf Features.

NOTE: Features listed in the `features.boot` files of the Maven Repositiries will take precedence over those listed in `featuresBoot.d`.

WARNING: Any existing repository registered in `org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.repositories` will be overwritten.
