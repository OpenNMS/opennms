/**
 * A UpsertTemplate for handling the update if it exists/insert if it doesn't case in the midst of 
 * concurrent database updates.  The pattern for solving this is known as an Upsert.. update or insert.
 * 
 * Example Scenario:  During a node scan an interface is found on a node and various information about
 * this interface is gathered.  This information needs to be persisted to the database.  There are two 
 * cases:
 * 
 * 1.  The interface is not yet in the database so it needs to be inserted
 * 2.  The interface is already in the database so it needs to be updated
 * 
 * The naive implementation of this is something like the following (this is just pseudo code)
 *
 *   // find an interface in the db matching our scanned info
 *   SnmpInterface dbIf = m_dao.query(scannedIf);
 *   if (dbIf != null) {
 *      // found an if in the db... updated with found info
 *      retrun update(dbIf, scannedIf);
 *   } else {
 *      // no if in the db.. insert the one we found
 *      return insert(scannedIf);
 *   }
 * 
 * Problem:  The naive implementation above has the problem that it fails in the midst of concurrency.
 * Consider the following scenario where two different provisioning threads decide to update/insert 
 * the same interface that does not yet exist in the db:
 * 
 * 1 Thread 1 attempts to find the if and finds it is not there
 * 2 Thread 2 attempts to find the if and finds it is not there
 * 3 Thread 1 inserts the if into the database
 * 4 Thread 1 completes and moves onto further work
 * 5 Thread 2 attempts to insert the if into the database and a duplication exception is thrown
 * 6 All work done in Thread 2's transactions is rolled back.
 * 
 * Most people assume the 'transactions' will handle this case but they do not.  The reason for this is
 * because transactions lock the information that is found to ensure that this information is not changed
 * by others.  However when you perform a query that returns nothing there is nothing to lock.  So this case
 * is not protected by the transaction.
 * 
 * Solution:  To handle this we must execute the insert in a 'sub transaction' and retry in the event of failure:  The
 * basic loop looks something like the following pseudo code:
 * 
 * while(true) {
 *   SnmpInterface dbIf = m_dao.query(scannedIf);
 *   if (dbIf != null) {
 *      return update(dbIf, scannedIf);
 *   } else {
 *     try {
 *       // start a new sub transaction here that rolls back on exception
 *       return insert(scannedIf)
 *     } catch(Exception e) {
 *        // log failure and let the loop retry
 *     }    
 *   }    
 * }
 * 
 * This is simplified loop because it does not show all of the code to start transactions and such nor to it show
 * the real.
 * 
 * As far as code goes this solution has a great deal of boiler plate code.  This class contains this boilerplate
 * code using the Template Method pattern and provides abstract methods for filling running the query and for doing the
 * insert and/or the update.  To use this class to do the above would look something like this:
 *
 * final SnmpInterface scannedIf = ...;
 * return UpsertTemplate<SnmpInterface>(transactionManager) {
 *    @Override
 *    public SnmpInterface query() {
 *       return m_dao.query(scannedIf);
 *    }
 *    @Override
 *    public SnmpInterface doUpdate(SnmpInterface dbIf) {
 *       return update(dbIf, scannedIf);
 *    }
 *    public SnmpInterface doInsert() {
 *       return insert(scannedIf);
 *    }
 *    
 * }.execute();
 * 
 * The above will handle all of the exceptions that can occur in the face of concurrent inserts and will properly either
 * insert or update the interface.
