#
# This properties file allows you to set global properties for the opennms
# application.  These properties will be set as system properties at the
# beginning of Java startup.  Any properties set on the Java command-line
# with -Dproperty=value will be overridden by these values.
#

# ###### ICMP ######
# OpenNMS provides three ICMP implementations. JICMP (legacy, IPv4-only),
# JNA (supports both IPv4 and IPv6), and JICMP6.
# 
# The JICMP implementation is what has traditionally been used in OpenNMS
# since 1.0, uses JNI.  It requires you to install a separate package
# (JICMP) which contains a shared library for interfacing with your system's
# ICMP APIs.
# 
# The JICMP6 core library is a version of the JICMP codebase which can speak
# ICMPv6, instead of ICMPv4. The OpeNMS JICMP6 pinger supports both ICMPv4
# and ICMPv6.  It delegates all ICMPv4 ping requests to the original JICMP
# JniPinger above and uses the JICMP6 library for ICMPv6 packets.  This is
# the default for OpenNMS 1.9.90 and up.
#
# Finally, the JNA implementation is written from the ground up to support
# IPv4 and IPv6, and takes advantage of the JNA project's ability to access
# native APIs without needing to distribute separate shared libraries.  It
# is, however, not as performant as the JICMP6 pinger, so it is not
# recommended unless you are in an environment which requires it.  This is
# the default ICMP implementation used in the remote poller, since it does
# not rely on any external native code to be installed outside of the JVM.
# 
# To use the JNI ICMPv4 interface only, use the following property setting:
#org.opennms.netmgt.icmp.pingerClass=org.opennms.netmgt.icmp.jni.JniPinger
#
# To use the JNA ICMPv4/ICMPv6 implementation, use the following property:
#org.opennms.netmgt.icmp.pingerClass=org.opennms.netmgt.icmp.jna.JnaPinger
#
# The default is set to use the JNI ICMPv4/ICMPv6 interface like so:
#org.opennms.netmgt.icmp.pingerClass=org.opennms.netmgt.icmp.jni6.Jni6Pinger

# By default, OpenNMS will start up if either ICMPv4 *or* ICMPv6 are
# available and initialize properly.  If you wish to force IPv4 or IPv6
# explicitly, set one or both of these properties to true.
#
#org.opennms.netmgt.icmp.requireV4=detect
#org.opennms.netmgt.icmp.requireV6=detect

# ###### SNMP ######
# OpenNMS provides two different SNMP implementations.  JoeSNMP is the
# original OpenNMS # SNMP Library and provides SNMP v1 and v2 support.
# SNMP4J is a new 100% Java SNMP library # that provides support for SNMP
# v1, v2 and v3.  
#
# To enable the JoeSnmp library uncomment the following line.
#org.opennms.snmp.strategyClass=org.opennms.netmgt.snmp.joesnmp.JoeSnmpStrategy
#
# The SNMP4J library is currently the default.  But can also be set with
# the following line.
#
# Default:
#org.opennms.snmp.strategyClass=org.opennms.netmgt.snmp.snmp4j.Snmp4JStrategy
#

# The world is full of buggy SNMP agents.  We can work around many of their
# quirks by extending various SMI classes from SNMP4J.  The following property
# must be set in order for any of these workarounds to be enabled.
org.snmp4j.smisyntaxes=opennms-snmp4j-smisyntaxes.properties

# When debugging SNMP problems when using the SNMP4J library, it may be
# helpful to receive runtime exceptions from SNMP4J. These exceptions almost
# always indicate a problem with an SNMP agent. Any that we don't catch will
# end up in output.log, so they're disabled by default, but they may provide
# more information (albeit without timestamps) than the messages that SNMP4J
# logs (see snmp4j.LogFactory) 
org.opennms.snmp.snmp4j.forwardRuntimeExceptions=false

# By default, SNMP4J does not do any logging internally, but it's easy to
# enable.  See log4j.properties to adjust log levels for these messages. 
snmp4j.LogFactory=org.snmp4j.log.Log4jLogFactory

# Net-SNMP agents prior to release 5.4.1 on 64-bit platforms exhibit a bug
# that causes the discovery of a node's interfaces to fail. A workaround has
# been made that helps SNMP4J cope with this bug. If for some reason you need
# to disable this workaround, comment out the following line.
org.opennms.snmp.workarounds.allow64BitIpAddress=true

# DrayTek Corporation, Router Model: Vigor2820 Series devices with a
# sysObjectID of .1.3.6.1.4.1.7367 sometimes present objects from the
# ipAddrTable with an instance ID of "0". To substitute a valid (though still
# dodgy) value of "0.0.0.0" when we encounter one of these, set the following
# property to true.
org.opennms.snmp.workarounds.allowZeroLengthIpAddress=true

# Some SNMP agents claim to support SNMPv2c, but either completely fail to
# respond to GET-BULK requests or return bad responses to them under some
# conditions. To disable the use of GET-BULK PDUs globally in the SNMP4J
# strategy, set this property to true. This change will adversely affect the
# efficiency of SNMP data collection from agents that properly support
# GET-BULK.
org.opennms.snmp.snmp4j.noGetBulk=false

# Some buggy SNMP agents fail to exclude Counter64 objects from view when
# responding to SNMPv1 requests (as mandated by RFC3584 § 4.2.2.1). To relax
# handling of v1 responses to permit Counter64 varbinds rather than discarding
# them as ill-formed (per the same RFC), set this property to true.
org.opennms.snmp.snmp4j.allowSNMPv2InV1=false

# ###### DATA COLLECTION ######
# On very large systems the OpenNMS default mechanism of storing one data
# source per RRD file can be very I/O Intensive.  Many I/O subsystems fail
# to keep up with the vast amounts of data that OpenNMS can collect in this
# situation.  We have found that in those situations having fewer large files
# with multiple data sources in each performs better than many smaller files,
# each with a single data source.  This option enables all of the data sources
# belonging to a single collection group to be stored together in a single
# file.  To enable this setting uncomment the below line and change it to
# 'true'.
# 
# Default: false
org.opennms.rrd.storeByGroup=false

# By default, data collected for a node with nodeId n is stored in the
# directory ${rrd.base.dir}/snmp/n . If the node is deleted and re-added,
# it will receive a new nodeId, and subsequent data will be stored in a
# new directory. This can create problems in data continuity if a large number
# of nodes get deleted and re-added either accidentally or intentionally.
# This option enables an alternate storage location for nodes that are
# provisioned (ie they have a foreignSource and foreignId defined) If
# storeByForeignSource is set to true, a provisioned node will have its
# data stored by foreignSource/ForeignId rather than nodeId. For example,
# a node with foreignSource/foreignId "mysource/12345" will have its data
# stored in ${rrd.base.dir}/snmp/fs/mysource/12345 . With this
# option enabled, data collection will continue to use the same storage
# location as long as the foreignSource/foreignId is not redefined, regardless
# of how many times the node may be deleted and re-added.
#
# Default: false
org.opennms.rrd.storeByForeignSource=false

# RRD base directory 
rrd.base.dir=${install.share.dir}/rrd

# RRD binary path (only used if the JniRrdStrategy is used)

# (check NMS-3473).
# In order to properly use scientific notation for the datasource's value,
# change the format rule to something like this '##.##E0' to avoid NMS-4126.
#
# Default: ##.##
#org.opennms.threshd.value.decimalformat=##.##

# Specifies the amount of time to wait (expressed in milliseconds) until the
# reload container physically checks if the datacollection-config.xml file
# has been changed.

###### JETTY HTTPS SUPPORT ######
# Details: http://www.opennms.org/index.php/Standalone_HTTPS_with_Jetty
# If you want Jetty to provide an HTTPS listener, this is the port to listen on
# Note that setting this property does NOT disable the plain HTTP listener,

#### REMOTE SETTINGS ####

# All settings on the remote pollers are controlled via command-line options. Look at these 
# wiki pages for more details.

###### JASPER REPORTS VERSION  ######
org.opennms.jasperReportsVersion=5.6.1

###### Web Console - Front Page ######
# This value controls the content that will be displayed in the middle box of the front page.
# The default is the view of SLM/RTC categories: /includes/categories-box.jsp.
# Uncomment the following line to display the widget for the surveillance view from the dashboard.
# (It uses the same rules for the dashboard)
#org.opennms.web.console.centerUrl=/surveillance-box.jsp


###### REMOTE POLLER MONITOR CLASS EXCLUSIONS ######
# This setting enables OpenNMS to exclude all references to certain services from the
# poller configuration that it sends to the remote location monitors. This is necessary
# when monitor classes are in use that are not included in the remote poller builds.
# Without this setting, the remote poller will crash on startup (see issue NMS-5777)
# even if none of the problematic services appears in any package. If you create custom
# services, you may need to add them to this list.
excludeServiceMonitorsFromRemotePoller=DHCP,NSClient,RadiusAuth,XMP

###### DASHBOARD/SURVEILLANCE VIEW IMPLEMENTATION ######
# OpenNMS provides two different dashboard/surveillance view implementations. The GWT
# variant is the original. Later, the UI was rewitten using the VAADIN framework. So, the
# two valid options fpr this option are 'vaadin' or 'gwt'. The VAADIN implementation is
# the default one. Please note that the GWT version is deprecated and will be removed in
# future versions.
#org.opennms.dashboard.implementation=gwt

###### DASHBOARD LANDING PAGE ######
# This setting controls whether users will be redirected to the dashboard page after
# a successful login. The two valid options for this are 'true' or 'false' which is
# the default value.
#org.opennms.dashboard.redirect=false

###### Graphing #####
# Use this property to set the graph rendering engine type.
# Supported values are:
#   png (default)
#   placeholder
#   backshift
#org.opennms.web.graphs.engine=png

###### HEATMAP ######
# The following options are used to configure the default behaviour of the
# heatmap visualization of outages and alarms.
#
# There exist two modes for operating the heatmap. Valid options
# are 'alarms' and 'outages'. The default is 'alarms'.
#org.opennms.heatmap.defaultMode=alarms
#
# The heatmap will work with categories or foreign sources. The
# default heatmap can be set here by choosing 'categories' or
# 'foreignSource'. The default is 'categories'.
#org.opennms.heatmap.defaultHeatmap=categories
#
# The following option is used to filter for categories to be displayed in
# the heatmap. This option uses the Java regular expression syntax. The default
# is '.*' so all categories will be displayed.
#org.opennms.heatmap.categoryFilter=.*
#
# The following option is used to filter for foreign sources to be displayed in
# the heatmap. This option uses the Java regular expression syntax. The default
# is '.*' so all foreign sources will be displayed.
#org.opennms.heatmap.foreignSourceFilter=.*
#
# You can use negative lookahead expressions for excluding categories you wish
# not to be displayed in the heatmap, e.g. by using an expression like '^(?!XY).*'
# you can filter out entities with names starting with 'XY'.
#
# The next option configures whether only unacknowledged alarms will be taken into
# account when generating the alarm-based heatmap.
#org.opennms.heatmap.onlyUnacknowledged=false
