# include.directory is a directory which will be checked for files with 
# names matching *.properties.  If it is a relative path (e.g. contains no path
# delimiters), it is relative to the directory this file is in.
# Each of those properties files will then be read and the graphs defined in
# them added to the list of prefabricated graphs that are available.
# Each of these included files can contain either a single graph, or multiple graphs.
# If it includes multiple graphs, use the same format as this file, e.g.
# a "reports" property listing the graph ids, and each graph is defined with 
# a set of 'report.<graphname>.<key>' properties
# If it includes just a single graph, you may use a short format.  In this format,
# an additional property "report.id" defines the internal "name" of the graph, and 
# all the other properties no longer require the graph name in the key. 
# For example, such a single-graph file would look like this:
#
#report.id=mib2.bits
#report.name=Bits In/Out
#report.columns=ifInOctets,ifOutOctets
#report.type=interfaceSnmp
#report.command=--title="Bits In/Out" \
# --vertical-label="Bits per second" \
# <rest of graph definition>
#
# Graphs in the include directory that have the same id as one in this root file
# will replace/override the one in this file.  
include.directory=snmp-graph.properties.d

#The minimum interval, in milliseconds, between rescans of the directory
#specified by include.directory, looking for new .properties files
# Defaults to 300000 (5 minutes) so as not to be hitting disk too often.
#include.directory.rescan=300000

# NOTE: Only OpenNMS internal graph definitions. Please create for 
#       customized graphs in snmp-graph.properties.d dedicated property
#       files
