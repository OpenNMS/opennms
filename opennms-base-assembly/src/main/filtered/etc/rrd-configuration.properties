# This file is the configuration for the the RrdUtils class.  It is used to
# specify the details of the Rrd backend

# Properties are defined but commented out indicating the default values.
#

#
# This property defines which RrdStrategy implementation to use for writing data to
# RRD files.  There are two RrdStrategies that ship with opennms.  The first one is
# org.opennms.netmgt.rrd.rrdtool.JniRrdStrategy.  It uses the original JNI RrdTool based code
# to write to the rrdtool compatible .rrd files.  The second version uses JRobin, a
# pure java implementation of RrdTool.  Its class name is 
# org.opennms.netmgt.rrd.jrobin.JRobinRrdStrategy
#
# To switch to the JNI implementation uncomment the following lines.  Note
# that paths may differ from one platform to the next, and a few platforms
# use an extension other than ".so" on JNI shared objects; Mac OS X notably
# uses ".jnilib":
#org.opennms.rrd.strategyClass=org.opennms.netmgt.rrd.rrdtool.JniRrdStrategy
#org.opennms.rrd.interfaceJar=/usr/share/java/jrrd.jar
#opennms.library.jrrd=/usr/lib/libjrrd.so
#
# The default setting is org.opennms.netmgt.rrd.jrobin.JRobinRrdStrategy
#org.opennms.rrd.strategyClass=org.opennms.netmgt.rrd.jrobin.JRobinRrdStrategy

#
# This property allows the definition of a custom file extension to use for data files.
# OpenNMS uses the extension to find which files to use.  The jrobin convertor tool will
# append .jrb to the filenames for the new files it creates.  This property will allow the 
# use of these new files by setting the extension to .rrd.jrb
#
# The default fileExtension is approperiate for the Strategy in use... JRobin uses .jrb and 
# JNI uses .rrd.  If you set a value here that value will be used regardless of the value preferred
# by the individual strategies.
#org.opennms.rrd.fileExtension=.jrb


#
# This property defines whether or not to use the write queuing system.  
# The write queuing queues rrd create and update operations so as not to
# lose collected data due to slow I/O performance.  As the I/O system gets
# behind this leads to multiple data points being stored per file update.
# This leads to greater amortized performance of the I/O system.  
#
# The default setting is true (use the queuing system)
#org.opennms.rrd.usequeue=true

#
# The following properties are for the queuing system
#
# This property defines how many threads to use to process the queue and
# write to the disk.  The JNI backend is only single thread safe and therefore
# synchronized so having more than two threads really only leads to contention.
#
# The JRobin code however is multi-thread safe and may get some performance benefit
# by increasing threads.  This of course depends on your I/O subsystem.  It is 
# unlikely that more than 10 threads or so are needed here but there may be some
# system where this is not true.
# 
# The default setting is 2
#org.opennms.rrd.queuing.writethreads=2

#
# This property defines whether creates should be processed immediately or enqueued.
# Setting it to true enqueues the creates and they are processed
# as the threads get to them.  False, causes the enqueuing thread to block as the
# files are created.  
#
# WARNING: There is currently a bug in the queueing of creates in that multiple creates
# will get queued if many updates happen and there is a lag in the actual creation
# due the delay of queuing.  This may cause the loss of some initial data.  It is not
# recommended that this be changed until the bug is fixed!
#
# The default setting is false (don't enqueue the creates)
#org.opennms.rrd.queuing.queuecreates=false

#
# The queuing system distinguishes between zero valued and non-zero valued updates.
# Zero-value updates are termed 'insignificant' by the queuing system and pushed
# down in priority compared with 'significant' updates which have non-zero values
# if you set the "org.opennms.rrd.queuing.prioritizeSignificantUpdates" property to
# "true". The default value is "false" because this optimization is only necessary
# on systems that are heavily-loaded by data collection.
# 
# As updates are queued, files which have significant updates in their list of
# pending updates are boosted in priority to ensure that their data is written as soon
# as possible.  Files with only insignificant updates are delayed until 'free time'
# exists on the write threads and they have time to be processed.
#
# Given this situation there is an inherent 'unfairness' which on busy systems will
# cause the files with only insignificant updates to never get written.  
# 
#org.opennms.rrd.queuing.prioritizeSignificantUpdates=false

# This property represents the number of seconds over which (on average) all
# insignificant files will be promoted to the significant list.  This ensures that
# all files will eventually get written.
#
# An example value for this file would be 21600.  This would cause all the 
# insignificant files to be pushed through the updates queue over a six hour period.
# 
# Setting the value to 0 means don't promote insignificant files at all.
# 
# The default setting is 0 (don't promote insignificant files).
#org.opennms.rrd.queuing.maxInsigUpdateSeconds=0

#
# This queuing system regularly prints statistics regarding queue size, pending 
# operations, enqueue rates, dequeue rates, etc.  These updates are printed every
# so often based on the number of updates that get processed by the system.
# 
# This property defines the modulus indicating how often to print the statistics.
# If (updateCount % modulus) == 0 then printStats;
#
# The default setting is 10000L
#org.opennms.rrd.queuing.modulus=10000

# On some very large installations it is possible to overwhelm the I/O system of the
# the NMS and continue queuing data until all of the JVM memory is used up.  The next
# three properties indicated high water marks beyond which collected data will be thrown
# away because it is not possible to continue queuing collected data.  The best mix of
# values for these will need to be experimentally determined based on your data collection
# requirements and I/O subsystem capabilities.
#
# When the totalOperationsPending value reaches or is higher than the value of the 
# below high water mark, any newly enqueued insignificant operations will be 
# discarded.  This will allow for the loss of only zero valued data and may be
# sufficient to keep your system from becoming overwhelmed.
#
# The default value is 0L (don't discard insignificant operations)
#org.opennms.rrd.queuing.inSigHighWaterMark=0

#
# When the totalOpsPending value reaches or is higher than the value of the below
# high water mark, any newly enqueue signficant operations will be discarded.  This
# will allow the system to 'catch up' by writing a higher percentage of high throughput
# insignificant operations.
#
# The default value is 0L (don't discard significant operations
#org.opennms.rrd.queuing.sigHighWaterMark=0

#
# When the totalOpsPending value reaches or is higher than the value of the below
# high water mark, any newly enqueued operations or any sort will be discarded, this
# will prevent the queue from using up all the memory of the system and eventually
# crashing the JVM. 
#
# The default value is 0L (don't discard operations)
#org.opennms.rrd.queuing.queueHighWaterMark=0


#
# This property defines which log4j category to use when printing the queue
# statistics
#
# The default setting is for the queueing daemon
#org.opennms.rrd.queuing.category=OpenNMS.Queued

#
# The following constants are related to how long a write thread lingers before
# it exits.  You probably don't need to change these.  Changing these values will 
# void your warranty.  grins.
# 
#org.opennms.rrd.queuing.writethread.sleepTime=50
#org.opennms.rrd.queuing.writethread.exitDelay=60000

#
# The following property sets the default JRobin backend Factory.  Acceptable values are
# FILE, SAFE, NIO, MNIO, MEMORY.  Default is FILE.
#
# Recommended backends:
# FILE - Standard RRD algorithm, cache when possible and no locking.
# MNIO - NIO ByteBuffer RRD implementation.  Experimental.  This will become the default
#        in future OpenNMS releases.  Note that this will use more memory than FILE.  The
#        additional memory usage is nominal, but can be can be computed with:
#            additinal memory = (jrb file size) * (number of queued write threads)
#        When queuing is disabled, the number of write threads becomes the number of 
#        Collectd threads since it is these threads that with then do the persisting.
# 
# Other backends (not recommended):
# SAFE - Aggressive locking and low levels of caching.  Untested.
# MEMORY - In-memory only.
# NIO - MMAPped RRDs, using NIO.
#org.jrobin.core.RrdBackendFactory=FILE

# If you would like to export performance data to an external system
# over a TCP port, please set org.opennms.rrd.usetcp to 'true' and fill
# in your values for the external listener. 
#org.opennms.rrd.usetcp=false

# The IPv4 address or hostname of the target system
#org.opennms.rrd.tcp.host=
#
# The TCP port where the target system is listening for performance data
