# ###### Alarm List Page Options ######
# Several options are available to change the default behaviour of the Alarm List Page.
# <opennms url>/opennms/alarm/list.htm 
#
# The alarm list page has the ability to generate a sound either on each new alarm
# or (more annoyingly) on each change to an alarm event count on the page.
# 
# Turn on the sound feature. Set true and Alarm List Pages can generate sounds in the web browser.
# opennms.alarmlist.sound.enable=false
#
# Set the default setting for how the Alarm List Pages generates sounds. The default setting can be 
# modified by users for the duration of their logged-in session using a drop down menu . 
#    off = no sounds generated by the page.
#    newalarm = sounds generated for every new alarm in the page
#    newalarmcount = sounds generated for every increase in alarm event count for alarms on the page
#
# opennms.alarmlist.sound.status=off

# By default the alarm list page displays acknowledged and unacknowledged alarms in separate search tabs
# Some users have asked to be able to see both on the same page. This option allows the alarm list page 
# to display acknowleged and unacknowledged alarms on the same list but unacknowledged alarms
# flash until they are acknowledged.
#
# opennms.alarmlist.unackflash=false
