<!-- 
  This file contains profiles for posting to and reading notices from
  one or more microblog services such as Identica, StatusNet, or Twitter.
  
  Currently these profiles are used only by the MicroblogNotificationStrategy
  and its ~Reply~ and ~DM~ derived classes.  These strategies will first try
  to use a profile whose name is "notifd", falling back to the default profile
  if one does not exist.
  
  Future uses for the profiles in this configuration file include an
  AckReader for Ackd and perhaps a MicroblogTransportMonitor for Pollerd.

		Twitter no longer supports username/password for application posting.
