-- Changes for RFC1232 (DS1 MIB):
--      Changes from RFC-1239 applied which include:
--              removing import of experimental,

                      "This variable describes the variety of Zero Code
                      Suppression used on the link, which in turn
                      affects a number of its characteristics.

                      ds1JammedBit refers the Jammed bit Zero Encoding,
                      in which the AT&T specification of at least one
                      pulse every 8 bit periods is literally implemented
                      by forcing a pulse in bit 8 of each channel.
                      Thus, only seven bits per channel, or 1.344 Mbps,
                      is available for data.

                      ds1B8ZS refers to the use of a specified pattern
                      of normal bits and bipolar violations which are
                      used to replace a sequence of eight zero bits (see
                      [14]).  In this context, all eight bits in a
                      channel are technically available for data, but
                      care must be taken with D4 encoded data to avoid
                      having HDLC Flag streams imitate spurious Yellow
                      Alarm conditions.  Typically, one bit per frame is
                      ignored to force flag streams to rotate, thereby
                      avoiding this error type.  CCITT Recommendation
                      G.703 [11] may be referred to for further
                      definition of these.

                      ds1InvertedHDLC refers to the practice, common on
                      HDLC encoded DS1 data links, of inverting the data
                      between the serial interface chip and the CSU.
                      Since HDLC guarantees one zero every 6 bits in the
                      worst case, while the standards call for (in
                      effect) at least one pulse every eight, inverted
                      HDLC enjoys 4/24 one's density on the line, which
                      may improve the effective clock stability of a DS1
                      line.  As with B8ZS, all eight bits in a channel
                      are technically available for data, but care must
                      be taken with D4 encoded data to avoid having HDLC
                      Flag streams imitate spurious Yellow Alarm
                      conditions.  Typically, one bit per frame is
                      ignored to force flag streams to rotate, thereby
                      avoiding this error type.

                      ANSI Clear Channels may use ds1ZBTSI, or Zero Byte
                      Time Slot Interchange (see [14]).

                      G.704 links, with or without CRC, use ds1HDB3 (see
                      [11]).  "

          -- the DS1 Fractional group

          -- systems utilizing a fractional DS1 capability


          -- The DS1 fractional table contains identifies which DS1
          -- channels associated with a CSU are being used to support a
          -- logical interface, i.e., an entry in the interfaces table
          -- from the Internet-standard MIB.  For Clear Channel
          -- implementations, exactly one ifTable entry corresponds to
          -- the CSU being managed.  In this very typical case, the
          -- variable ds1Index indicates the value of ifIndex which
          -- corresponds to the interface being supported by a
          -- particular CSU.

          -- However, for fractional DS1 implementations, the
          -- correspondent value of ds1Index is 0, and for each DS1
          -- channel supporting a logical interface, there is an entry
          -- in the DS1 fractional table which names a value for
          -- ifIndex.

          --      For G.704, there are 32 legal channels, numbered 1
