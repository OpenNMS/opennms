-- Changes for RFC1233 (DS3 MIB):
--      Changes from RFC-1239 applied which include:
--              removing import of experimental,
--              adding import of transmission, changing
--              ds3 to be { transmission 30 }
--              instead of { experimental 15 }
--      Changed definitions and references from "DS3" to "Ds3" for
--              the following: DS3ConfigEntry, DS3IntervalEntry,
--              DS3CurrentEntry, DS3TotalEntry
--      Question: should the description for ds3SendCode say
--              "DS3" instead of "DS1"?
