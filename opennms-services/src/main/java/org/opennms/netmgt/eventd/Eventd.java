/**
 * <p>
 * Eventd listens for events from the discovery, capsd, trapd processes and
 * sends events to the Master Station when queried for.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Eventd receives events sent in as XML, looks up the event.conf and adds
 * information to these events and stores them to the db. It also reconverts
 * them back to XML to be sent to other processes like 'actiond'
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Process like trapd, capsd etc. that are local to the distributed poller send
 * events to the eventd. Events can also be sent via TCP or UDP to eventd.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Eventd listens for incoming events, loads info from the 'event.conf', adds
 * events to the database and sends the events added to the database to
 * subscribed listeners. It also maintains a servicename to serviceid mapping
 * from the services table so as to prevent a database lookup for each incoming
 * event
 * </P>
 *
 * <P>
 * The number of threads that processes events is configurable via the eventd
 * configuration xml
