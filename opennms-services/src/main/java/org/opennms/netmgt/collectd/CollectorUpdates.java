/**
 * The CollectorUpdates class encapsulates changes to a SnmpCollector which is
 * actively being collected by the collectd scheduler. When associated with a
 * SnmpCollector object the updates represented by the class are to be applied
 * to the SnmpCollector AFTER being popped from the interval queues for
 * scheduling but BEFORE the next collection takes place.
 * 
 * This is necessary because it isn't possible to make modifications to the
 * SnmpCollector objects at the time that a particular event is received by the
 * BroadcastEventProcessor class...the interface may in fact be in the process
 * of being collected. So we make "note" of the updates using this class and
 * wait for the collector object to be popped from the interval queues before
 * the updates are actually applied.
 * 
 * The only "updates" currently handled by this class are new/modified
 * attributes, a flag indicating that the service has been marked for deletion,
 * a flag indicating the service has been marked for reparenting, a flag
 * indicating the service has been marked for reinitialization, and finally a
 * flag indicating that the SNMP service on the interface has a new status.
