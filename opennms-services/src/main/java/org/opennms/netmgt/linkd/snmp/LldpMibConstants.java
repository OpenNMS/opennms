    DESCRIPTION
            "This TC describes the source of a chassis identifier.

            The enumeration 'chassisComponent(1)' represents a chassis
            identifier based on the value of entPhysicalAlias object
            (defined in IETF RFC 2737) for a chassis component (i.e.,
            an entPhysicalClass value of 'chassis(3)').

            The enumeration 'interfaceAlias(2)' represents a chassis
            identifier based on the value of ifAlias object (defined in
            IETF RFC 2863) for an interface on the containing chassis.

            The enumeration 'portComponent(3)' represents a chassis
            identifier based on the value of entPhysicalAlias object
            (defined in IETF RFC 2737) for a port or backplane
            component (i.e., entPhysicalClass value of 'port(10)' or
            'backplane(4)'), within the containing chassis.

            The enumeration 'macAddress(4)' represents a chassis
            identifier based on the value of a unicast source address
            (encoded in network byte order and IEEE 802.3 canonical bit
            order), of a port on the containing chassis as defined in
            IEEE Std 802-2001.

            The enumeration 'networkAddress(5)' represents a chassis
            identifier based on a network address, associated with
            a particular chassis.  The encoded address is actually
            composed of two fields.  The first field is a single octet,
            representing the IANA AddressFamilyNumbers value for the
            specific address type, and the second field is the network
            address value.

            The enumeration 'interfaceName(6)' represents a chassis
            identifier based on the value of ifName object (defined in
            IETF RFC 2863) for an interface on the containing chassis.

            The enumeration 'local(7)' represents a chassis identifier
            based on a locally defined value."

            "This TC describes the source of a particular type of port
            identifier used in the LLDP MIB.

            The enumeration 'interfaceAlias(1)' represents a port

            RFC 2863.

            byte order and IEEE 802.3 canonical bit order), which has
            been detected by the agent and associated with a particular
            port (IEEE Std 802-2001).

            The enumeration 'networkAddress(4)' represents a port
            identifier based on a network address, detected by the agent
            and associated with a particular port.

            identifier based on the agent-local identifier of the circuit
            (defined in RFC 3046), detected by the agent and associated
            with a particular port.
