/**
 * The ThresholderUpdates class encapsulates changes to a SnmpThresholder which
 * is actively being threshold checked by the threshd scheduler. When associated
 * with a SnmpThresholder object the updates represented by the class are to be
 * applied to the SnmpThresholder AFTER being popped from the interval queues
 * for scheduling but BEFORE the next collection takes place.
 * 
 * This is necessary because it isn't possible to make modifications to the
 * SnmpThresholder objects at the time that a particular event is received by
 * the BroadcastEventProcessor class...the interface may in fact be in the
 * process of being checked. So we make "note" of the updates using this class
 * and wait for the thresholder object to be popped from the interval queues
 * before the updates are actually applied.
 * 
 * The only "updates" currently handled by this class are new/modified
 * attributes, a flag indicating that the service has been marked for deletion,
 * a flag indicating the service has been marked for reparenting, a flag
 * indicating the service has been marked for reinitialization, and finally a
 * flag indicating that the SNMP service on the interface has a new status.
