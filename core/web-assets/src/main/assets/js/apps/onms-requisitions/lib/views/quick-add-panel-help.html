<p>
This workflow provides a quick way to add a node to an existing
provisioning requisition in this OpenNMS system.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note: This operation <em>will</em> override any un-synchronized
modifications made to the selected requisition.</strong>
</p>

<p>
<em>Basic Attributes</em> are common to all nodes. Select the requisition
into which this node should be added, provide an IP address on which OpenNMS
will communicate with the node, and enter a node label. The node label will
serve as the display name for the node throughout OpenNMS.
</p>

<p>
<em>Surveillance Category Memberships</em> are optional and work like tags.
A node can be a member of any number of surveillance categories, and the
names of those categories can be used in a variety of powerful ways throughout
the OpenNMS system.
</p>

<p>
<em>SNMP Parameters</em> are optional and apply only to the node being
requisitioned. If no values are specified here, OpenNMS' system-wide SNMP
configuration will be used to determine the appropriate values for the IP
address entered in the <em>Basic Attributes</em> section. If the node does not
support SNMP, the "No SNMP" box should be checked. Configuring SNMPv3
parameters via the web UI is not supported; contact your OpenNMS administrator
if this node requires SNMPv3 parameters that differ from those in the
system-wide configuration.
</p>

<p>
<em>CLI Authentication Parameters</em> are optional and will be used only if one
or more provisioning adapters are configured to use them. Typically this is the
case if OpenNMS is integrated with an external configuration management system.
