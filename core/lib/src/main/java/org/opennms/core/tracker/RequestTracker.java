/**
 *
 * Request Tracker Design
 *
 * The request tracker has four components that are all static
 *
 * a messenger
 * a pending requests map
 * a callback queue (LinkedBlockingQueue)
 * a timeout queue (DelayQueue)
 *
 * It also has two threads:
 *
 * a thread to process the callbacks (Callback-Processor)
 * a thread to process the timeouts (Timeout-Processor)
 *
 * Thread Details:
 *
 * 1.  The callback processor thread is responsible for handling all of the callbacks to
 *     the request object. This thread will pull callbacks off the linked blocking queue
 *     and issue the call in the order in which they were added.
 *
 *     All of the callback are handled from a single thread in order to avoid synchronization
 *     issue in processing the replies and responses. In the versions of the tracker before 0.7,
 *     it was possible for RequestTracker to receive a reply, but issue the timeout before it had
 *     a chance to process it.
 *
 * 2.  The timeout processor is only responsible creating callbacks for timeouts, and adding these
 *     to the callback queue when timeouts occur. The timeout processor pulls the requests off a DelayQueue
 *     and creates a callback if the request had not yet been processed. Note that a DelayQueue does not allow
 *     things to be removed until the timeout has expired.
 *
 * Processing:
 *
 * All requests are asynchronous (if synchronous requests are need that
 * are implemented using asynchronous requests and blocking callbacks)
 *
 * Making a request: (client thread)
 * - create a request (client does this)
 * - send the request (via the Messenger)
 * - add it to the timeout queue
 *
 * Replies come from the messenger:
 * - as replies come in, the messenger invokes the handleReply method on the request tracker
 *   (which was passed during initializing)
 * - the handleReply method adds a callback that will process the reply to the callback queue
 * - when called, this callback will:
 * -- look up and remove the matching request in the pendingRequest map
 * -- call request.processReply(reply) - this will store the reply and
 * -- call the handleReply call back
 * -- pending request sets completed to true
 *
 * Processing a timeout: (Timeout-Processor)
 * - take a request from the timeout queue
 * - if the request is completed discard it
 * - add a callback to the callback queue process the timedout request:
 * - when called, this callback will:
 * -- discard the request if it was completed
 * -- call request.processTimeout(), this will check the number
 *    of retries and either return a new request with fewer retries or
 *    call the handleTimeout call back
 * -- if processTimeout returns a new request than process it as in Making a request
 *
 * Processing a callback: (Callback-Processor)
 * - take a callback from the callbackQueue queue
 * - issue the callback
 */

/**
 * A class for tracking sending and received of arbitrary messages. The
 * transport mechanism is irrelevant and is encapsulated in the Messenger
 * request. Timeouts and Retries are handled by this mechanism and provided to
 * the request object so they can be processed. A request is guaranteed to
 * have one of its process method called no matter what happens. This makes it
 * easier to write code because some kind of indication is always provided and
 * so timing out is not needed in the client.
