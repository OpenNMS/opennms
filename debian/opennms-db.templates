Type: note
Description: The OpenNMS installer must now be run manually
  Previous versions of this package would invoke the installer to handle
  initial setup, or upgrade an existing database. This is no longer the
  case. You must manually run /usr/share/opennms/bin/install to complete
  this install/upgrade. Full install documentation can be found in the
  opennms-doc package or viewed online at the OpenNMS wiki,
  (http://www.opennms.org/index.php/Official_Documentation).
