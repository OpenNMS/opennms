Description: Enterprise-grade Open-source Network Management Platform (Full Install)
 OpenNMS is an enterprise-grade network management system written in Java.
 .
 OpenNMS can monitor various network services to determine status and service
 level availability.  Data collection is performed using protocols such as SNMP
 to generate reports and alert on thresholds.  An extensible event management
 and notification system handles both internally and externally generated
 events (such as SNMP traps), and generates notices via email, pager, SMS, etc.
