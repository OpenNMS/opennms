opennms (1.1.3-1woody) stable; urgency=low

  * Not yet released
  * New upstream release
  * Updated for new java-based build and install system.
  * Updated opennms-db postinst to allow trusted access from host
    'localhost' instead of local, (needed for new installer).
  * Added libgetopt-mixed-perl as a dependency for common, removed it
    as a dependency for contrib, (it was backward before, this is how
    it should have been).
  * Added opennms-common as a dependency for opennms-db.
  * Added a symlink to CATALINA_HOME/server/lib for upstream copy of 
    log4j and removed dependency on package from Debian repository.
  * Reverted log4j.properties back to upstream defaults.
  * Changed opennms-db.postinst and opennms-db.postrm to be kinder
    about starting and stoping the database, (see
    http://bugs.opennms.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=814).
  * Moved opennms.sh wrapper from /usr/bin to /usr/sbin

opennms (1.1.2-1woody) stable; urgency=low

    /usr/share/java/webapps/opennms/WEB-INF/web.xml to make tomcat happy.
  * Changed the post-install of opennms-webapp and opennms-db, since
    install.pl now runs as root.

  * Replaced reference to /opt/Opennms with /usr/share/opennms in init script.
  * Added dependency on libgetopt-mixed-perl for opennms-contrib,
    (send-event.pl requires it).

opennms (1.1.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Tax Man Cometh" release!

  * Split up packages again to use an opennms-db package for all database
    stuff.

    only package that needs them (webapp has it's jars in WEB-INF/lib).

    remove perl since it is required by libdbd-pg-perl.
